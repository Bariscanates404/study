## Preface

> On the first point, ‘modelling a system’ is a guarantee of deadlock because it has no end. There is no criterion for leaving things out – so it is easy for everything to get thrown in and for the work to get bogged down. Modelling is the art of leaving things out. The solution is to model a problem, not a system.

> Those who have experienced decision-making in organisations know that a little structure, a little disciplined thinking, can add immeasurably to the quality of a group process. Making things better, not trying to make them perfect, is the aim.

> It creates learning. The ideal outcome of any systems thinking work is not a model. Rather, it is a group of people who rise from the table with a shared understanding of what they are going to do and what its consequences will be.

> Some weeks into my course one of my students enthusiastically said to me, ‘This is the way that I have always wanted to think. Except I did not know that THIS was the way I had always wanted to think’
