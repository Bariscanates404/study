- [borkdude/deflet: Make let-expressions REPL-friendly!](https://github.com/borkdude/deflet) #clj #twtp
	- Write inline-defs like you would in a Rich comment form, so you can evaluate things expression by expression as you go:
	  ```clojure
	  (comment
	    (def x 10)
	    (inc x) ;;=> 11
	  )
	  ```
	  but now without polluting the global environment in production / library code:
	  ```clojure
	  (deflet
	    (def x 10)
	    (inc x)
	  ) ;;=> 11
	  ```
