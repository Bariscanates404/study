	- **How to override shortcuts defined by some plugin?**
	  I have a plugin called logseq-tabs. It defines shortcuts for navigating to next/previous tab. I want to override these commands. But I cannot find the keyword of the corresponding command.
	  
	  For the built-in commands, the keywords are defined in logseq/config.cljs at master · logseq/logseq · GitHub
	  
	  But what about the commands defined by the plugins? Is there a way to find out the keywords of these commands as well?
