	intro
		concepts
			nature of value and value co-creation
			organizations, service providers, service consumers, other stakeholders
			products and services
			service relationships
			value: outcomes, costs, and risks
		service management: org capabilities for making value 
	2.1 Value and value co-creation
		purpose of org: create value for stakeholders
		value: perceived benefits, usefulness
		Value co-creation
			before: service providers similar to delivery companies
			now: value co-created with consumers and other stakeholders
	2.2 Organizations, service providers, service consumers, and other stakeholders
		Organization: 
		Service providers
			provisioning services: an org takes role of service provider
		Service consumers
			receiving services: an org takes role of service consumer
			sub-roles:
				customers: defines reqts + responsibility for the outcomes
				user: who uses service
				sponsor: authorizes budget
		Other stakeholders
			partners and suppliers
			investors, shareholders
			regulators
			social groups
	2.3 Products and services
		Configuring resources for value creation
			Orgs have acess to several resuorces
			Products are configurations of these resources
			Services: customer doesn't manage costs and risks
			Product: configuration of orgs resources
		Service offerings: may include goods, access to resources, and service actions
			goods: mülkiyet tüketicidedir. ex: mobile phone
			access to resources: ex: mobile network, network storage
			service actions: ex: user support, replacement of equipment
	2.4 Service relationships
		provide service + cooperate with consumers in service relationships
		bir org bir yerde servis tüketicisi, öbür yerde sağlayıcısıdır
		The service relationship model
		/Users/mertnuhoglu/gdrive/keynote_resimler/screencapture/scs20210530_173226.jpg
		service relationships include: 
			service provision
				management of resources, deliver service, 
				ensuring access to resource for users, 
				fulfillment of agreed service actions, 
				service level management, continual improvement
			service consumption
			service relationship management
				joint activities by provider+consumer
				to ensure value co-creation
	2.5 Value: outcomes, costs, and risks
		Outcomes
			output: deliverable of an activity
			outcome: result for a stakeholder 
			output: ex: photo album where photos are arranged
			outcome: ex: remembering memories
			Business relationship manager (BRM): müşterilerle ilişkilerin yönetimi
		Costs
			costs removed by the service (value proposition)
			costs imposed by the service (cost of service consumption)
		Risks
			risks removed by the service (value proposition)
			risks imposed by the service (cost of service consumption)
			Critical success factors (CSF): that apply to the service
		Utility and warranty
			Utility: functionality offered to meet a need
				= what the service does
			Warranty: Assurance that service will meet requirements
				related to service levels
				addresses availability of service
ch03 The four dimensions of service management
	intro
		organizations and people
		information and technology
		partners and suppliers
		value streams and processes
	3.1 Organizations and people
	3.2 information and technology
	3.3 partners and suppliers
		Relationships between organizations
			Form of cooperation
				Goods supply
				Service delivery

	3.4 value streams and processes
		Value stream: series of steps to create services
		process: a set of activities that transforms inputs to outputs
ch04 The ITIL Service Value System
	4.1 Service value system overview
		Guiding principles
		Governance
		Service value chain
		Practices: org resources
		Continual improvement
	4.2 Opportunity, demand, and value
	4.3 The ITIL guiding principles
		guiding principle: guides in all circumstances
			focus on value
			start where you are
			progress iteratively with feedback
			collaborate and promote visibility
			think and work holistically
				no service stands alone
			keep it simple and practical
				if something fails to provide value, eliminate it
			optimize and automate
		adopting agile without ITIL
			higher costs over time
			costs to release and maintain software incerements
		adopting ITIL without ITIL
			risk losing focus on value for users
			slow-moving bureaucracies
		start where you are
			assess where you are
			When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. Goodhart's Law
	4.4 Governance
		Governing bodies and governance
			governing body: a group who is accountable at the highest level for the performance of the org

		6 activities:
			plan
			improve
				improvements all levels
			engage: understanding needs
				interaction with external parties
			design and transition
			obtain/build
				new resources are obtained
			deliver and support
