## 1.3 Systems: Open and Feedback

Open system: Outputs have no influence on the inputs.

It is not aware of its own performance. Past action doesn't control future action. It does not observe and react to its own performance. 

Ex: Automobile, watch.

Feedback (closed) system: influenced by its own past behavior

Negative feedback: seeks a goal

Positive feedback: action builds a result that generates still greater action.

Whether a system is open or closed? This is not intrinsic to the particular assembly of parts. It depends on the observer's viewpoint in defining the purpose of the system.

Ex: gasoline engine. Different viewpoints:

1. The engine without a governor. It is an open system in terms of speed regulation. 

2. Adding a governor that seeks constant-speed goal. 

3. Assume engine is part of lawn mower. Goal: mowing the lawn. It is open system because it has no awareness of what grass is cut.

4. Adding a person operating the lawn mower. Goal seeking system.

5. Assume lawn-care enterprise. The operator and his equipment is an open system.

6. Adding management function. Customer requirements is the guide.
