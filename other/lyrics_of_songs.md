## Letras Identidad Santiagueña

Mario Alvarez Quiroga

Soy ese cantor, señores
De profesión santiagueño
Tengo el corazón amigo
Y el alma llena de sueños
Y una garganta cantora
Para expresar lo que siento

De chango me cobijaba
La plaza grande del centro
Allí lustraba zapatos
De los señores del pueblo
Y me ganaba la vida
Sacando brillo a los cueros

Amo el olor del chipaco
Del mistol y el pan casero
Por eso es que cuando canto
Denuncio de donde vengo
Porque hay en mi voz
Aroma de Santiago del Estero

Los cantores santiagueños
Honramos a nuestra tierra
Porque tenemos el alma
Tallada en buena madera
Y en el corazón llevamos
Estirpes de chacarera

Soy ese cantor, señores
Embajador santiagueño
De piel morena y curtida
Por los infiernos de enero
Y un corazón con espinas
De los tunales bandeños

Soy cantor de cielo abierto
Gorrión de muy bajo vuelo
Para no estar nunca lejos
Del reclamo de mi pueblo
Porque es un honor muy alto
Ser un juglar santiagueño

No hacen falta diccionarios
Ni libros de geografía
Para cantarle al paisaje
Al hombre y a las salinas
Y a las típicas costumbres
De toda la tierra mía

Los cantores santiagueños
Honramos a nuestra tierra
Porque tenemos el alma
Tallada en buena madera
Y en el corazón llevamos
Estirpes de chacarera
¡Gracias!

## Letras La Estrella Azul	

¿donde estara la estrella azul?
Esa estrellita del alma ...
Sus ojos suelen brillar
Perdidos en la inmensidad.

A veces sueño que esta aqui
Y se ilumina el camino
Cuando aparece el fulgor
Cerquita del corazon.

¿donde estara la estrellita azul?
Ya no podre con mi dolor
En otros cielos brillara
Esa estrellita del amor.

En una lagrima quedo
Hasta perderse en el cielo,
Mi corazon se partio
Atravesado de penas.

A nadie puedo preguntar
Con las palabras del alma.
Es mi tristeza un papel
Que el viento no deja caer.

## Lyrics Let's Go Fly a Kite

With tuppence for paper and strings
You can have your own set of wings
With your feet on the ground
You're a bird in a flight
With your fist holding tight
To the string of your kite

Oh, oh, oh!
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height!
Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go fly a kite!

When you send it flyin' up there
All at once you're lighter than air
You can dance on the breeze
Over 'ouses and trees
With your first 'olding tight
To the string of your kite

Oh, oh, oh!
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height!
Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Let's go fly a kite!

## Lyrics Somewhere over the Rainbow

Judy Garland

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why oh why can't I?

## Lyrics Blowin In The Wind

Bob Dylan, Tom Petty

How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Yes, and how many years must a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
And how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
And how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take 'til he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

## Lyrics Puff the Magic Dragon

Peter, Paul and Mary

Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee
Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff
And brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff
Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee
Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee
Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail
Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail
Noble kings and princes would bow whene'er they came
Pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name
Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee
Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee
A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys
Painted wings and giant's rings make way for other toys
One gray night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more
And Puff, that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar
His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane
Without his lifelong friend, Puff could not be brave
So Puff, that mighty dragon, sadly slipped into his cave
Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee
Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee

## Lyrics Que Será, Será

Doris Day

When I was just a little girl
I asked my mother, what will I be
Will I be pretty
Will I be rich
Here's what she said to me

Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera, sera
What will be, will be

When I grew up and fell in love
I asked my sweetheart, what lies ahead
Will we have rainbows
Day after day
Here's what my sweetheart said

Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera, sera
What will be, will be

Now I have children of my own
They ask their mother, what will I be
Will I be handsome
Will I be rich
I tell them tenderly

Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera, sera
What will be, will be
Que sera, sera
