## Preface

Marlene Bergeron:

One area this really helps is during arguments and misunderstandings. I can stick to the “root cause” of the disagreement, so to speak. Instead of falling into old baggage discussions, . . . I can stay focused on the facts and avoid coming to the wrong conclusions.

It is often said, “What gets measured gets done.” Unfortunately, the truth of this often creates serious problems. Many people are measuring the wrong things and, based on their measurements, taking the wrong actions. If we measure the right thing in the right way, we gain insight and leverage for positive, lasting change. If we measure the wrong things or measure in the wrong way, only luck will help us.

Dr. Deming was that there is no knowledge without theory.

## Chapter 01: The Fundamental Principles of Dr. Deming’s Approach

This book is about is how to create positive change in organizations and individuals. We often see hysterical blindness in both. What is wrong is obvious to us, but they may not be able to see it. Our challenge is to find leverage for change.

Usually when we are trying to change people and organizations, applying strong force generates an equal force in the opposite direction

Few listened to Dr. Deming until the quality of Japanese products overwhelmed American products in the marketplace

Dr. Deming’s approach to management is founded on two fundamen- tal principles

### Principle 1: People will do their best to do what they think is expected of them.

MUCH OF WHAT HAS EVOLVED AS THE PRACTICE OF MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION SEEMS TO DERIVE FROM THE ASSUMPTION THAT, GIVEN THE CHANCE, WORKERS WILL ATTEMPT TO AVOID DOING WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

However, much of what has evolved as the practice of management and supervision seems to derive from the assumption that, given the chance, workers will attempt to avoid doing what needs to be done and will do something else altogether. Unfortunately, this assumption is often a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Employees’ work is checked, measured, audited, and rechecked. This is expensive and slows down the work. More important, it sends the message to employees that they are not trusted to do a good job.

Divided responsibility means that no one is responsible. Having one person check or approve another’s work is a case of divided responsibility and will degrade accuracy rather than promote it.

If a check must be made, it must be completely independent. Rather than review a calculation, the calculation must be repeated independently and then compared.

A crucial aspect of this first principle is that people will do their best to do what they think is expected of them, not what is actually expected of them. Having someone check others’ work is a subtle way of telling those being checked that they are not trusted to do the job properly.

For example, if an incen- tive plan specifies no accidents, that can be achieved by not reporting any even if they do occur. If it specifies a sales quota, then employees will try to meet it, even if they have to cut prices and eliminate profit altogether

Certainly I believe that having final authority changed my thinking process for the better. In fact, bureaucracies are created by expanding rules and reduc- ing authority. When the rule makes no sense, it must still be enforced, cir- cumvented, or ignored. Enforcement of a nonsense rule destroys the credibility of other rules and encourages circumvention and ignoring of rules in general, even those that are there for very good reasons. That is the essence of bureaucracy.

### Principle 2: To improve performance you need to improve the system rather than focus on the individuals.

DR. DEMING ARGUED THAT THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING HE TAUGHT IN JAPAN IN 1950 WAS THAT A BUSINESS SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A SYSTEM.

The sys- tem included not only the various departments of the company but also external agencies, including suppliers and customers.

The chief point made by the diagram is that the diverse parts of the company, including many that are not in the company, such as customers, form an interconnected system. You cannot act in one part of the system without influencing the others.

Dr. Deming argued that at least 85 percent of the variation in perfor- mance of a business derived from the system and at most 15 percent from the individuals in the system. When the majority of workers are performing poorly, the problem is in the system not the workers.

Collins conducted a five-year study of companies that had trans- formed themselves from mediocre to outstanding. The study was published in Collins’s book Good to Great

Several common threads emerged. First, you have likely never heard of any of the CEOs. They were all humble people who built teams of excel- lent colleagues. They had to develop a staff of very com- petent team players. The particular skills of the people were not what was critical. What was important was their competence and their ability and willingness to contribute to a team effort.

A second thread was finding the right formula

It further decided that its economic engine would be revenue per customer visit, rather than profit per store. This led Walgreens to do some surprising things. If they had a store in the middle of the block and the corner became available, they would move, because the corner was more convenient.

### THE 14 POINTS FOR MANAGEMENT

1. Create constancy of purpose for the improvement of product and service, with the aim to become competitive, stay in business, and provide jobs

2. Adopt the philosophy of cooperation (win-win) in which everybody wins. Put it into practice and teach it to employees, customers, and suppliers. 

3. Cease dependence on mass inspection to achieve quality. Improve the process and build quality into the process in the first place. Inspection will not improve quality, because quality comes from the manufacturing process.

4. End the practice of awarding business on the basis of price tag alone. Instead, minimize total cost in the long run. Move toward a single supplier for any one item and a long-term relationship of loyalty and trust.

5. Improve constantly and forever the system of production, planning, or any activity that will improve quality and productivity and thus constantly decrease costs.

6. Institute training for skills

7. Adopt and institute leadership for the management of people, recognizing their different abilities, capabilities, and aspirations. The aim of leadership should be to help people, machines, and gadgets do a better job. Leadership of management is in need of overhaul, as well as leadership of production workers. 

Leaders need to manage with an understanding that not all people are the same and that it is possible to create an effective system that takes advantage of this variation in people, rather than attempting to stifle it.

8. Drive out fear and build trust so that everyone can work effectively

fear is especially damaging to cooperation and creativity

frightened workers will not tell us about problems or near misses

9. Break down barriers between departments. Abolish competition and build a win-win system in the organization

10. Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets asking for zero defects or new levels of productivity. Such exhortations create only adversarial relationships, as the bulk of causes of low quality and low productivity belong to the system and thus lie beyond the power of the workforce.

11. Eliminate numerical goals, numerical quotas, and management by objectives. Substitute leadership.

The problem is that goals, by themselves, accomplish nothing. Rather than establishing goals and quotas, the job of leadership is to improve the system.

12. Remove barriers that rob people of joy in their work. This will mean abolishing the annual rating or merit system that ranks people and creates competition and conflict. To the extent that intrinsic motivation is present, people will enjoy work. Intrinsic motivation is the motivation that comes from the work itself.

13. Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement

It is not possible to write procedures that can cover every eventuality. Education can equip workers with knowledge that will help in those situations where the procedures do not exist

14. Put everybody in the company to work to accomplish the transformation. The transformation is everybody’s job. 

### APPLYING THE 14 POINTS

Deming was not against reviewing employee’s work. He did have serious questions about the ability of most managers to evaluate the performance of employees accurately, because that performance is the output of the employee working in the system rather than of the employee alone.

Alternative: Such a discussion would cover the perceived performance of the employee and the potential systemic barriers to improving that performance.

## Chapter 02: Dr. Deming’s System of Profound Knowledge

Profound knowledge is scientific knowledge: theory that has been tested through rigorous observation

Profound knowledge comprises four disciplines that Deming felt were fundamentally important to business: statistics, or the mathematics of vari- ation; psychology; the theory of knowledge; and the theory of systems

### Variation

The mathematics of variation is called statistics. Some knowledge of vari- ation is essential to conducting any process of measurement, because vari- ation is a property of all measured phenomena. Without an understanding of the laws of variation, it is likely that many inappropriate conclusions will be drawn from the data.

@mine: Varyansın büyüklüğünü anlayabilmeli. Ortalamaların farklı olması durumunda bu her zaman birinin diğerinden daha iyi olduğu anlamına gelmez. Rassallıkları iyi anlayabilmeli.

Deming explained that accidents should vary according to a Poisson dis- tribution (Deming 1993). This is what we expect if accidents are independent of each other and if the probability of an accident’s occurring in one period of time is the same as in any other period.

When a plant has an unusually high number of accidents in a period, it is common for management to ask what is wrong or suggest that some measures be taken to improve the situation. Without statistical analysis, it is not possi- ble for management to know if anything has changed. Most of the time the unusual periods represent nothing more than random variation. Therefore, most of these communications are counterproductive. At best, they waste time, and at worst, they cause ill-advised actions on the part of local manage- ment. Deming called this kind of management intervention that ignores the laws of variation tampering.

### Psychology

Because managers generally manage people, they are necessarily practitioners of psychology.

Perhaps the greatest misconception about psychology is how incen- tives function. From the 1940s through the 1970s, behaviorism was a prominent school of psychology, exemplified by Skinner and his students. Behaviorism was anchored by the belief that incentives, which they termed positive reinforcement, were the fundamental mechanism for controlling behavior.

Skinner showed that even complex behaviors could be developed through the use of positive reinforcement by using a process called shaping. In shaping, the subject receives reinforce- ment at first for a small component of the desired behavior. When the sub- ject learns to do that, then an additional component is added.

In fact, they often do the opposite of what we would expect. For an excellent discussion of some of the problems of incentives, see Alfie Kohn’s Punished by Rewards (1995). Kohn notes, for example, that many studies have demonstrated that positive reinforcement actually undermines intrinsic motivation. If a person enjoys doing some- thing, then paying the person to do it will actually make the activity less attractive.

A simple example is found in programs in which a strong incentive is provided for not having any accidents. A common result of this is nonreporting.

One problem is that punishment creates fear, and fear is not compatible with learning, creativity, or cooperation. Punishment will certainly establish superficial compliance

#### Incentives and Attitudes

In fact, increasing the pay often decreases the employee’s loyalty to the company.

To understand this, we turn to the the- ory of cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance (Festinger 1957) is a theory of attitude change that was developed to explain some experiments that initially appeared to give counterintuitive results.

Surprisingly, the students who were paid the least showed the most change.

The experimenters reasoned that students who advocated a position they did not believe in, but who were paid well, could rationalize the speech by saying they did it because of the money. Those who were paid very little did not have this rationalization. Instead, they had to rationalize by deciding that the position was not really so bad, thereby changing their attitude in the direc- tion of that position. The theory states that when people have two thoughts (cognitions) that are incompatible (dissonant), they will change their attitude in order to make the thoughts less dissonant.

#### Perception and Memory

We do not create an endless video and audio record in our head that can be accessed completely

The optic system transmits a great deal of information about the environment to the brain, but the perception is **constructed** from this information.

For example, new scientific theories are rejected as absurd until they are widely adopted. Then no one can understand how we believed anything else.

In 1982, the Australian scientists Barry Marshall and Robin Warren (Marshall 2002) discovered the bacterium helicobacter pylori in the stom- achs of ulcer patients. For over 10 years, with strong scientific evidence behind them, they attempted to convince physicians that ulcers were a result of bacterial infection. They were told this was absurd. Bacteria could not live in the strong acidity of the stomach.

Our discussion of cognitive dissonance might give us a potential rem- edy for this. If we could induce workers and managers to discuss what can go wrong, and in fact advocate the position that an unfavorable outcome would occur, they would be more likely to entertain the idea that an unfa- vorable outcome (accident) would occur and might modify their behavior to prevent it. In fact this may be the reason for the success of the job safety analysis (JSA), in which workers discuss potential hazards of a task before it is undertaken.

a process similar to JSA, which they call risk management

The solution is not to make a stronger case but rather to induce the line managers to analyze hazards themselves. By having them make the case, we should see a rise in their estimate of the probability and ultimate risk of an accident.

### Theory of Knowledge

The theory of knowledge, related to the philosophy of science, is critical to Dr. Deming’s approach to business. It defines the rules of how knowledge is acquired. Deming asserts, quite properly, that knowledge is based on the- ory. A theory is a model of reality that allows us to predict outcomes.

That is why after-the-fact expla- nations are not necessarily theories. They are only theories if they make future predictions that can be tested.

Psychoanalytic theory, for example, is not a theory. Any conceivable thought or behavior can be explained by it.

Heinrich depicted the relationship between minor incidents and major accidents in the form of a triangle, sim- ilar to that depicted in Figure 2.3. He asserted that severity of accidents was largely fortuitous and that, therefore, frequency and severity should bear a constant relationship. That is clearly not the case (Manuele 2003; Petersen 2000). Although it means that Heinrich was wrong about this particular, at least he presented us with a testable theory.

One of the conclusions to be drawn from the assertion that knowledge requires theory is that it would make sense to teach theory to workers. A worker armed with an extensive set of rules and procedures does not nec- essarily have the tools necessary for safe work. These procedures and rules do not constitute knowledge.

Rules and procedures can never cover every eventuality. Moreover, the more extensive and complex the rules and procedures, the less likely they will be known, understood, and followed. Learning of theory would allow the worker to make predictions if something unforeseen happened.

Humans, when properly trained and educated, are very good at react- ing appropriately to conditions that were not anticipated by the program- mers of nonhuman controls. Humans make great humans. Perhaps it would be better to let machines do more of watching routine processes and spend that human time training and learning how to react to the alarms or non- routine events when they inevitably occur.

They may remember the procedures, but do they have any theory? If you avoid teach- ing the theory, you need to assume that you can write procedures to cover every possible event.

A critical component of the theory of knowledge is the **operational definition**. An operational definition defines a construct by providing suffi- cient information to measure it. For example, hunger is a feeling most of us have experienced. However, if we want to study hunger scientifically, we need to define it operationally. We might define it through self-reports, such as “my hunger is 7 on a 10-point scale.” We might define it as the amount of time since the last meal.

### Theory of Systems

@alirızakaylan: neden kalite yönetimi dersinde bilgi teorisi ve sistem teorisi konularına hiç girilmiyor? eğer bu derslerle başlansaydı, tamamen bambaşka gerçek entellektüel insanlar yetiştirilirdi.

Deming called his explication of business as a system “the spark that ignited Japan.” The crucial insight Japanese executives got from Deming was that a business is a system of interrelated parts, and that the crucial function of management is to manage the whole rather than attempting to manage the parts separately.

It follows from this, and from Deming’s assertion that most problems lie in the system rather than in individuals, that we should consider the theory of systems.

#### Definition of a System

A system is a set of interrelated components that work together to perform a function. No part in the system can perform the function of the system on its own. The output of the system is not just the arithmatic sum of the out- puts of the parts but is a result of the interaction of the parts as well. If inter- action does not matter, you do not have a system

An excellent example of a system is an automobile. It is an assembly of several thousand parts that work together to provide a transportation function. None of the individual parts will move you.

Collections of parts do not necessarily make a system. A football team is highly integrated. The runners cannot run if the blockers do not block.

The whole is not equal to the sum of the parts.

#### Optimizing the Parts Does Not Optimize the Whole

Good automobiles are a set of compromises. The most important thing is that the parts work together as a system.

The cultural system represents the attitudes, beliefs. For example, in organizations that have a history of short-lived initiatives that are soon replaced by new initiatives, employees come to expect the flavor of the month. Thus, any new initiative is greeted with cynicism and resistance that will be passive at best and active at worst.

Attempts to optimize the system by isolating and optimizing each part are not likely to succeed.

#### Systems Include Mechanisms for Stabilization

Even when we attempt to improve the right things, we often fail because of the stabilization prin- ciple of systems theory: systems include mechanisms for stabilization. Complex systems are stable and in balance. Either way, stable systems can be very resistant to change.

#### A Stable System Will Not Change Itself

According to Dr. Deming, a stable system in business will not change with- out introducing profound knowledge from outside the system. The impor- tant point here is that without new understanding of the system you want to change, your efforts to change it are likely to be wasted. As Dr. Deming said, “Best intentions are not enough.” Without new knowledge, good inten- tions will only result in wasted effort.

Attempting to increase safety emphasis is a strategy based on best inten- tions instead of increased understanding of the system. Increasing emphasis on safety must imply a decrease in emphasis on something else.

When safety is put in competi- tion with other priorities, such as production, a balancing system is estab- lished that will limit both safety and production. As safety emphasis increases and the memory of the accident recedes, attention shifts to prob- lems of productivity. Of course, a side effect of this strategy over time is that employees learn that priorities are temporary. This creates cynicism and also makes it increasingly difficult to alter actual practices. The only way out of the impasse is to develop solutions that improve both safety and productiv- ity.

@mine: aynı durum tüm kalite çalışmaları için geçerli. kalite işlerine odaklanmak, verimlilikte düşüşe neden olabilir. bu durumda iki taraf arasında bir gerilim olur. ikisini birden paralel götürecek bir çalışma yapmalı. 

#### Obvious Solutions Often Make Things Worse

Any action taken in a complex system has multiple effects. A good exam- ple is the use of drugs to treat illness. We say a drug has a therapeutic effect and a variety of side effects.

By the same token, we should expect any intervention in a business to have multiple side effects. Some of these would be immediate and some would be long term. Because of these side effects, intended solutions often have an effect that is opposite to that desired.

#### A Complex System Has Leverage Points for Change

In order to change a system for the better, we must understand the system and identify a leverage point. A leverage point is a point at which efficient and effective action can be taken to initiate change. Action at the leverage point will not create side effects that defeat our purpose.

When we diet, these mechanisms are activated. At least two things happen: our appetite increases, and our metabolic rate decreases. anyone who has attempted to lose weight knows that we have not yet found the leverage point.

In spite of the free availability of birth control, extensive government programs to control population, and widespread understanding that overpopulation was destructive to the nation, rural families were pro- ducing, on average, seven children. Arthur and McNicoll interviewed peo- ple in the villages and discovered a rather simple explanation. Because children could go to work at a very early age, they were a benefit to the family. If a woman was widowed, her relatives might come and steal all of her property. Children could defend her against this. Of course, the lever- age point is the position of widows in the society, not the availability of birth control or encouragement to use it.

#### System Archetypes

Although moment-to-moment predictions of output are not possible with complex systems, they often behave according to regular patterns, called system archetypes.

Escalation. Terrorism acts. -> punishment -> retaliation

price wars

ex: discipline. accident -> more safety rules and punishment -> rule violations for getting things done -> management ignores them -> accident -> more rules to punish

Tragedy of the commons: In an apocryphal story told by Garrett Hardin, the ranchers in a community are allowed to graze their sheep on common land owned by the community. 

Enlightened self-interest alone will not solve the problem. People who display greed rather than enlightened self-interest will be rewarded in this system. Such a problem can be dealt with only if a higher authority allocates the resource.

ex: managers' time. managers’ time does not represent a cost to corporate staffs. To the extent that staff organizations can impose requirements on line organi- zation, they are grazing on a common resource. As more and more staff units begin to impose requirements, request reports, and so on, employees’ time in the organization is overgrazed, and it becomes difficult to do any single task properly.

We frequently observe middle managers rushing from meeting to meeting so often that it would be impossible for them to have the time to prepare for any one of them prop- erly.

We recall a conversation with the captain of an oil tanker who said that, as a result of the Exxon Valdez incident, the number of overlapping regula- tors who called on him when he put into a U.S. port was so great that he rarely got much sleep when he was in port. However, he had to be at his sharpest when leaving the port to ensure safety.

Fixes that fail: 

Increased emphasis on safety puts it into a position to compete with other objectives. When safety emphasis is increased, time and attention will be diverted from other important activities, such as quality, mainte- nance, planning, and production.

They are missing Dr. Deming’s admonishment to improve the system constantly and forever. The proper solution is to find ways to improve the processes of planning and production in such a way as to improve safety, quality, and produc- tivity, all at the same time.

Shifting the burden:

It consists of taking a problem and making it someone else’s problem, in spite of the fact that the root causes of the problem have nothing to do whatever with the party to whom the bur- den has been shifted.

Although excellent safety performance certainly requires the involvement and commitment of employees, that involvement is strongly influenced by the employees’ perception of management’s involvement and commitment.

Correctly viewed, the problem is systemic. Both the employees and management are part of that system. It is unlikely that either group, working in isolation, could do very much.

## Chapter 03: Some Principles of Measurement

### THE PLAN-DO-STUDY-ACT CYCLE

Planning involves collecting and analyzing data about the system.

@mine: önce veri topla, bunun illa metrik olması şart değil. 

What gets measured is what gets done:
• What gets measured is often not the correct thing.
• Therefore, what gets done is often not the correct thing.

The question is, what is good measurement?

### THE SCIENCE OF MEASUREMENT

The quality of a measure is determined by its reliability and validity. No measure is perfect.

#### Reliability

Essentially, reliability refers to the repeatability of a measure.

To judge the reliability, we would ask whether a different audit team, unaware of the initial team’s evaluation, would give the same or similar score.

Reliability is not a property of the instruments, but of the entire mea- surement process. This includes the tools, the instruments, the proce- dures, and the people.

#### Validity

Validity relates to whether you are measuring what you want to measure.

When we are measuring a complex process, such as aptitude to perform well in college or the ability of the safety-management system in a plant to prevent future loss, validity becomes a serious question. Scientists (Chronbach and Meeh 1955) generally define three categories of validity: content-related, criterion-related, and construct-related validity.

**Content-related validity**. This is often called face validity.

It addresses whether the content of the measurement process is, on its face, related to the purpose of the measurement. A good example is found in safety audits. If one of your questions asks whether employees use personal protective equipment on the factory floor, the question has face validity. If you ask whether the workers go out for beer together after work, that lacks face validity, because nothing in the content appears to have anything to do with safety.

**Criterion-related validity**. This is sometimes called predictive validity. It deals with whether our measure correlates with other measures that could be called criteria. For example, the SAT test is an attempt to measure the likeli- hood that a student will succeed in college.

Minor injuries should not be the total focus of a safety effort. However, because the performance of managers is often based on incident rates, and because most incidents are relatively minor, managers tend to focus disproportionately on these minor incidents.

Because criteria are usually somewhat arbitrary, and because there is often no single, ultimate criterion, it is best to use several criteria when attempting to establish criterion-based validity.

**Construct-related validity**. This goes to the understanding of what you are measuring.

A MEASURE WITH MODERATE RELIABILITY AND HIGH CONSTRUCT-RELATED VALIDITY IS MUCH TO BE PREFERRED OVER A MEASURE WITH VERY HIGH RELIABILITY AND LITTLE OR NO EVIDENCE OF CONSTRUCT-RELATED VALIDITY.

One of the problems we frequently encounter in business is a tendency for managers to prefer measures they believe to be highly reliable, in spite of the lack of any evidence regarding the validity of those measures. Many managers believe that surveys and interviews are of doubtful reliability and that the measurement of incident rates is quite reliable. In fact the data show that surveys and interviews can be very reliable, whereas recording incidents is frequently unreliable.

## Chapter 04: Incident-Based Measures

In addition to the problem of inconsistent criteria is the problem of intentional distortion of the measure. Virtually any measure is subject to manipulation.

### Reliability

#### Variation in Recording Criteria

Differences in recording create a problem when companies seek to find benchmarks. When benchmarking on safety, the accident rate is often used to determine who has the best safety performance.

In addition to the problem of inconsistent criteria is the problem of intentional distortion of the measure. Virtually any measure is subject to manipulation. Dr. Deming provided frequent examples of this. One of the simplest was in an apple-sorting process. The measure of performance was the number of good apples sorted.

If employees know they will get a safety bonus if they meet their goal, the minor injuries they would normally have reported go unreported. 

Ex: Use of over-the-counter ibuprofen instead of prescription dosages. If the prescription is not used, then there is no requirement to record the incident.

A serious problem is that the events being measured are so complex that systems to define and count them must be elaborate and cumbersome. In addition, there are often strong incentives attached to the numbers achieved. This complexity provides more and more opportunity for errors or manipulation, both intentional and unintended.

#### Variation in the Statistic Itself

### VALIDITY

#### Content-Related Validity of Incident-Based Measures

Treating all events the same and assuming that by preventing minor inci- dents you proportionally reduce the likelihood of more serious events causes organizations to attack the easiest causes first.

#### Criterion-Related Validity of Incident-Based Measures

They argued from the data that the inci- dent rate was a poor measure for predicting catastrophic loss. Better pre- dictors were: (1) The complexity of the system. More complex, tightly coupled (continuous-processing) systems have the highest danger. (2) The number of toxic releases

#### Construct-Based Validity

Case 4: 

By focusing on reporting, measuring, and acting on all events, the site had lost its ability to distinguish between the important and the trivial. Managers and nonmanagers alike were intent on measures for the incentive program and lost sight of what the incentive plan was intended to effect.

Of course, the problem here is that all actions taken were local and not leveraged. System causes were not identified. Instead, we have a flurry of meaningless activity and wasted effort.

WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PRIORITIZE WHERE
OUR RESOURCES AND EFFORTS ARE APPLIED.

In this case, when we began to look into the organizational culture, we found that the most significant barrier to change and improvement was fear. Further analysis indicated that a key demonstration of man- agement’s desire to improve the system would be their willingness to revise how they conducted accident investigations. A retired union leader told us they had coached their members to respond only to ques- tions asked and never to volunteer any information. They did this to protect themselves and their union brothers and sisters. He relayed that the company had missed many of the real causes of accidents simply because they had not asked the right questions.

On reflection, the site management began to understand that they had always looked for the human factor (a human-error scapegoat) first. To compound the problem, the human error found was almost always the nonmanagement or nonsupervisory one.

### PROPER USE OF ACCIDENT STATISTICS

It is critical that normal fluctuations of the measure, within the control limits, not be treated as signs that the process has changed. Acting on these random fluctuations as though they represent process changes is called tam- pering. Tampering not only wastes resources but usually makes the perfor- mance of the system worse.

#### Examples of the Use of Control Charts for Recordable Accidents

However, it is not useful to instruct employees to work safely. It is clearly a violation of Dr. Deming’s point 10: Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets asking for zero defects or new levels of productivity. Such communications are insulting to workers. The appropriate vehicles for management’s demonstration of sup- port are allocating resources to safety and personal involvement in the improvement process. Telling others to make improvements is not an effec- tive form of personal involvement.

A point fell beyond the upper con- trol limit of the process, or more than 3 standard deviations from the mean. Whenever this occurs, it is very important to try to determine the cause. In Deming’s terminology, this is a special cause; in Shewhart’s, this is an assignable cause.

## Chapter 05: Incident Investigation

The particular approach one takes to incident investigation depends in part on one’s theory of incident causation. Investigations based on Heinrich’s domino theory would seek to find the culprit or circumstance that tipped the first domino. In our experience, a culprit can usually found. The majority of investigations that we have reviewed point to an error, usually an error made by an operator. The prevalence of such findings often leads managers to assert that if they could just get better workers, there would be fewer acci- dents. These findings, in turn, lead them to create motivational programs

A better approach would be to understand the systemic causes of acci- dents. Deming asserted that at least 85 percent of defects, including acci- dents, derive from the system not from individuals.

In our experience, methods like the causal-tree analysis, management oversight and risk tree (MORT), and the fishbone diagram are all suitable for

### Reliability

One of us has trained over 100 groups in the causal-tree investigation process. The final step in the training is to break the group into two or three teams and provide them with the same set of facts. Our estimate is that over 90 percent of the teams develop the same basic logic diagram.

#### Who Should Investigate

#### How to Investigate

Type 1: Traditional, informal investigation performed by immediate supervisor
Type 2: Committee-based investigation using expert judgment to find a credible solution of cause and remedy
Type 3: Multiple-cause, systems-oriented investigation that focuses on root-cause determination, integrated with an overall process safety-management program

The investigation-system style we prefer is one that uses free-flow logic that documents the relationships among the facts of an event. These are usu- ally referred to as causal-tree diagrams.

Causal tree methods begin with listing facts, followed by constructing a diagram (tree) of the facts following specific logic steps or queries.

The facilitator leads an investigation team to establish a list of facts related to the incident. The team then iden- tifies the end result, the accident, and asks, which of the facts were directly necessary for the end result to have occurred? Then they ask whether that fact was, in and of itself, sufficient to have caused the end result? If the answer to the second question is yes, that fact then becomes the next end result to be analyzed. If the answer is no, that fact was not by itself suffi- cient to have caused the end result.

### Validity

## Chapter 06: Systematic Observation of Behavior

In 1980, Thomas Krause and his associates began the application of applied behavioral analysis to industrial safety.

THE FIRST STEP IN THE OBSERVATION OF BEHAVIOR IS TO DEVELOP
A LIST OF BEHAVIORS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO SAFE WORK.

The first step is to identify critical behaviors. These are behaviors that are critical to safety. Krause (1997) lists four ways to iden- tify these behaviors: (1) behavioral analysis of injury reports, (2) worker interviews, (3) observation of the work process, and (4) review of work rules, job safety analysis, procedures, and so on. Krause feels that 1 is most impor- tant but is not simple

Krause, like Deming, points out the importance of **operational definitions** as key to any systematic measurement. An operational definition of a behavior is a definition that would allow many different observers to make the same decision as to whether the behavior occurred. For example, if a critical behavior is the wearing of eye protection, you might define it as “wearing eye protection whenever a hazard is present.” This is not a good operational definition. It does not define eye protection. Are glasses enough? Are safety glasses enough? Are side shields required? Nor does it define what it means for a hazard to be present. A better definition would be, “wears safety glasses with side shields whenever present on the factory floor.”

### RELIABILITY

WITH PROPER ATTENTION TO OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS AND TRAINING OF
OBSERVERS, THE OBSERVATION CAN BE MADE VERY RELIABLE.

### VALIDITY 

#### Content-Related Validity

THE MANNER IN WHICH THE LIST OF CRITICAL BEHAVIORS IS DEVELOPED
ENSURES A DEGREE OF CONTENT-BASED VALIDITY.

#### Construct-Related Validity

Here is where the issues become quite complex. A construct is part of a the- ory. Hunger is a construct. It cannot be measured directly.

Krause does not take this position (Skinner's theory rejection position). In his 1996 book, Krause argues that “Deming has overshadowed Skinner.” Whereas Skinner asserted that theories of behavior were scientifically inappropriate, Deming argued that there is no knowledge without theory. According to Deming, the reason for theory is to enable prediction. Although Skinner also sought prediction, he did so in a much more limited sense.
