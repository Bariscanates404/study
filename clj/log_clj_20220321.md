[(4) specter v.s. meander v.s hand-crafted code when restructuring data : Clojure](https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/izh9o4/specter_vs_meander_vs_handcrafted_code_when/)

Dustin Getz, bu yaklaşımı çok doğru bulmuyor. Doğru yöntem, öncelikle çok katmanlı hiyerarşiyi, yassılaştırmaktır,  diyor.

> Trees with multi-level nesting can often be flattened into EAV graph form which is flat/normalized & much more expressive to work with, see this thread https://twitter.com/stuartsierra/status/1275215836832305154 . Clojure is uniquely good at programming with graphs – perhaps because the lack of ADTs and pattern matching, and resulting map fatigue, has forced the issue – though this style could be more popular. Datomic being proprietary has been a major impedance.

Stuart Sierra:
