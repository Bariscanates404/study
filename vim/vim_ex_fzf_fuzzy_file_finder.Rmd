Most of the examples are taken from fzf wiki: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/Examples-(vim)

``` vim
call fzf#run({'sink': 'e'})
``` 

`fzf#run()` function takes a dictionary as argument. This dictionary has two important keys: `sink` and `source`. `sink` is the channel where `fzf` output is redirected. `source` is the data stream where `fzf` makes search.

For example, the above function call uses the default `source` which is the default find command. The `sink` is `e` command of Vim. Thus it will open the selected file with `e`. 

Instead of `e` we could also use `tabedit`

``` vim
call fzf#run({'sink': 'tabedit'})
``` 

Or instead of using the default find command as input data stream, we can use any shell command that produces some data stream. For example:

``` vim
call fzf#run({'source': 'git ls-files', 'sink': 'e'})
```
