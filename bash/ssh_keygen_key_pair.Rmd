## Creating a password protected private key 

Following https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#platform-linux and https://www.ssh.com/ssh/keygen/

``` bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -m PEM -b 2048
``` 

## Adding key to ssh agent

Adding keys to ssh agent lets the need for passwords to be supplied only once.

``` sql
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
``` 

## Password protect (encrypt/dercypt) file

This is only needed if you want the public key to be secured as well.

Following https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-easily-encryptdecrypt-a-file-in-linux-with-gpg/

``` bash
gpg -c id_rsa.pub
```
