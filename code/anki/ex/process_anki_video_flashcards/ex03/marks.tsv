00:01:26.720	00:01:28.324	"MAX: I've lived in this city all my life."
00:01:29.000	00:01:32.886	"I'm Max. <br> And I'm the luckiest dog in New York"
00:01:34.840	00:01:36.285	"That's Katie."
00:01:36.440	00:01:39.284	"Katie and I... <br> Well, we have the perfect relationship."
00:01:40.280	00:01:41.611	"We met a few years ago."
00:01:42.760	00:01:46.441	"And, boy, let me tell ya, <br> - we got along right away."
00:01:46.560	00:01:49.729	"It was one of those relationships <br> - where you just know."
00:01:51.680	00:01:52.806	"And get this!"
00:01:52.960	00:01:55.964	"She was looking for a roommate. <br> And so was I!"
00:01:56.120	00:01:59.090	"So I just moved in that same day."
00:01:59.240	00:02:00.890	"- It was perfect."
00:02:01.520	00:02:03.443	"- We've been together ever since."
00:02:05.440	00:02:07.727	"Katie would do anything for me."
00:02:07.880	00:02:14.084	"- And I'm her loyal protector."
00:02:19.080	00:02:23.729	"Our love is stronger than words. <br> Or shoes."
00:02:31.920	00:02:34.640	"Us against the world."
00:03:02.480	00:03:04.767	"There's just one little problem."
00:03:04.880	00:03:09.447	"- Pretty much every day... <br> Come on, Max. <br> ...she leaves."
00:03:10.640	00:03:11.801	"I'll see you tonight."
00:03:22.600	00:03:26.684	"Okay. That's a good boy. <br> MAX: But it never works."
00:03:27.920	00:03:29.365	"Where is she going?"
00:03:31.320	00:03:33.800	"What could she possibly be doing?"
00:03:35.840	00:03:38.840	"Oh, I miss her so much."
00:03:40.800	00:03:42.370	" Oh my! She's back!"
00:03:43.360	00:03:44.521	"-  <br> - Forgot my phone."
00:03:51.000	00:03:53.571	"I miss her so much."
00:04:06.200	00:04:07.645	"Any plans today?"
00:04:07.760	00:04:10.880	"Uh, yes. <br> Big, big stuff today, <br> Gidget. I got big plans."
00:04:10.960	00:04:14.009	"I'm gonna sit here, and I'm gonna <br> wait for Katie to come back."
00:04:14.160	00:04:15.525	"Oh, that sounds exciting."
00:04:17.400	00:04:20.165	"I've got a very busy day, too. "
00:07:12.600	00:07:15.809	"Hey, Chloe, do you ever wonder <br> where they go during the day?"
00:07:15.920	00:07:17.365	"Do you know what? I just..."
00:07:17.520	00:07:19.010	"I don't really care. "
00:07:19.160	00:07:20.889	"Maybe that's what it's like for you,"
00:07:21.040	00:07:22.769	"but Katie and I have <br> a different relationship."
00:07:22.960	00:07:25.167	"You're a cat. So maybe that's why."
00:07:25.320	00:07:27.607	"Because nobody could ever love <br> a cat the way they love a dog."
00:07:27.800	00:07:29.802	"I'm just saying. Maybe that's why."
00:07:29.960	00:07:32.122	"Whatever you need to tell yourself."
