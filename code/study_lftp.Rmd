### Disable SSL Certification Verification

When you get error:

As we know SSL certificates are approved by the authorities. But in some cases servers can use unapproved certificates. This will create following error.

		Fatal error: Certificate verification: Not trusted

Turn off SSL certificate verify:

Edit `~/.lftp/rc` or `/etc/lftp.conf`

``` bash
set ssl:verify-certificate no
```
