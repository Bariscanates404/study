00:02:18.040	00:02:19.519	"This was it."
00:02:19.600	00:02:21.750	"The moment it all began."
00:02:21.840	00:02:25.469	"The moment an ordinary little guy <br> fell in love with the theater."
00:02:26.360	00:02:27.679	"Everything about it."
00:02:27.760	00:02:28.795	"The lights,"
00:02:28.880	00:02:31.952	"the way the scenery moved, <br> even the smell."
00:02:32.040	00:02:34.235	"He was only six years old, <br> but his plans to become"
00:02:34.320	00:02:37.517	"the first koala bear in space <br> were suddenly toast."
00:02:38.720	00:02:41.280	"Some folks may have said he grew <br> up to be the greatest showman"

00:02:42.960	00:02:45.190	"Some called him a visionary, <br> a maverick."
00:02:46.760	00:02:49.274	"Sure, some folks said he was <br> as crazy as he was stubborn,"
00:02:49.360	00:02:53.148	"but I say wonder and magic <br> don't come easy, pal."
00:02:53.240	00:02:55.754	"And, oh, there would <br> never be any doubt."
00:02:55.840	00:03:00.277	"The name Buster Moon would go <br> down in entertainment history."
00:03:00.360	00:03:01.839	"And I should know."
00:03:01.920	00:03:04.150	"Because I am Buster..."
00:03:04.280	00:03:06.748	"- Moon! <br> - Open this door!"
00:03:07.240	00:03:09.176	"Good morning, Mr. Moon."
00:03:09.200	00:03:11.794	"Miss Crawly. What, uh... <br> What's going on?"
00:03:11.960	00:03:15.111	"You got a lot of animals <br> waiting to see you, Mr. Moon."
00:03:15.320	00:03:16.435	"I do?"
00:03:17.720	00:03:19.790	"Holy moly, I really do!"
00:03:19.880	00:03:22.519	"Yeah, it's the <br> stage crew from your last show."
00:03:22.960	00:03:24.632	"They say <br> their paychecks bounced."
00:03:24.800	00:03:26.296	"Tell them I'll call up <br> the bank and make sure"
00:03:26.320	00:03:27.435	"they're paid tout de suite."
00:03:27.640	00:03:31.428	"Oh, I got Judith from the bank <br> holding on line two right now, sir."
00:03:31.920	00:03:33.616	"Um, actually, I'm gonna <br> have to call her back."
00:03:33.640	00:03:35.471	"Oh. What should I <br> tell her this time?"
00:03:35.600	00:03:37.955	"Tell her Buster Moon <br> is out to lunch."
00:03:38.680	00:03:41.240	"Moon! <br> Open this door!"
00:03:43.160	00:03:44.160	"Come on, Moon!"
00:03:44.480	00:03:45.879	"I know you're in there!"
00:03:56.280	00:03:57.280	"Moon!"
00:03:57.440	00:03:58.839	"Open this door!"
00:04:55.960	00:04:58.110	"Mmm! Thought I heard <br> someone singing there."
00:04:58.560	00:04:59.709	"Ah, whatever."
00:05:02.680	00:05:03.680	"Guys, listen!"
00:05:03.760	00:05:05.512	"Stay where you are. <br> The cops are here..."
00:05:06.720	00:05:08.438	"What are you... <br> Hold it right there!"
00:05:12.320	00:05:13.320	"Go, go, go!"
00:05:19.120	00:05:20.394	"Whoa!"
00:05:21.200	00:05:23.760	"Johnny, you were supposed <br> to be keeping a lookout!"
00:05:24.040	00:05:25.040	"Sorry, Dad."
00:05:25.200	00:05:26.315	"And where's your mask?"
00:05:48.840	00:05:50.956	"Look at me, I'm Mommy!"
00:05:52.760	00:05:54.273	"Caspar, get off the table."
00:05:54.640	00:05:57.108	"Rosita, have you seen <br> my car keys?"
00:06:01.280	00:06:03.953	"Norman, would you please tell <br> them what a good singer I am?"
00:06:04.040	00:06:05.951	"Oh, yeah, <br> you were great, honey."
00:06:06.360	00:06:08.510	"And by the way, the bathroom <br> sink is blocked again."
00:06:09.400	00:06:10.515	"Bye, honey!"
00:06:21.640	00:06:23.995	"One, two. <br> One, two, three, four!"
00:06:42.640	00:06:44.153	"Oh, my gosh!"
00:06:44.320	00:06:46.675	"I thought you guys <br> said you were musicians!"
00:06:48.160	00:06:50.993	"Ash, babe. <br> I'm the lead singer, okay?"
00:06:51.080	00:06:52.296	"Just stick to <br> the backing vocals."
00:06:52.320	00:06:53.912	"Sorry, I get carried away."
00:06:54.000	00:06:55.558	"Yeah, I know, right?"
00:06:55.640	00:06:57.756	"It just kind of ruins <br> my song, you know?"
00:07:24.040	00:07:25.440	"MEENA'S MOTHER <br> AND GRANDMOTHER: Aww!"
00:07:25.600	00:07:26.715	"What?"
00:07:26.840	00:07:28.114	"Come on, make your wish."
00:07:28.880	00:07:32.509	"Hmm! I wish you'd join a choir. <br> A local band, or something."
00:07:33.040	00:07:34.519	"I tried! <br> Bah!"
00:07:34.640	00:07:36.437	"Hey, hey, Dad! <br> We've been over this."
00:07:36.560	00:07:38.869	"So she's a little shy. <br> So what?"
00:07:38.960	00:07:43.590	"If I had a voice like Meena's, <br> I'd be a superstar by now!"
00:07:43.680	00:07:44.795	"Just singing..."
00:07:46.080	00:07:49.390	"Sure you would, Grandpa. <br> Now blow out your candles."
00:08:06.720	00:08:07.835	"A penny?"
00:08:07.920	00:08:08.989	"How dare you!"
00:08:09.160	00:08:11.360	"I happen to have studied at <br> the Lincoln School of Music!"
00:08:11.600	00:08:13.238	"Sorry, it's all I got <br> right now."
00:08:13.800	00:08:15.233	"Oh, is that so?"
00:08:17.440	00:08:18.998	"All right, prove it, pal! <br> What?"
00:08:19.160	00:08:20.320	"Empty your pockets right now!"
00:08:20.400	00:08:21.400	"Trying to find..."
00:08:21.800	00:08:23.576	"What is this you got here? <br> I'm just trying to find..."
00:08:23.600	00:08:24.736	"What do you smoke out of this?"
00:08:24.760	00:08:26.591	"That's my inhaler."
00:08:27.400	00:08:29.470	"A-ha! I knew it!"
00:08:30.080	00:08:32.640	"You all saw it! You all saw it right here! <br> The monkey lied!"
00:08:33.760	00:08:35.136	"I forgot I had that."
00:08:35.160	00:08:36.275	"And next time,"
00:08:36.360	00:08:38.476	"pick on someone your own size!"
00:08:38.560	00:08:39.913	"You bully!"
00:08:49.840	00:08:51.432	"Take care of her, will you?"
00:08:51.520	00:08:54.796	"She may look old and rusty, <br> but she is a classic!"
00:09:00.960	00:09:02.837	"Okay, listen. <br> We both know that my theater"
00:09:02.920	00:09:05.195	"has been going through some <br> pretty rough times lately."
00:09:05.280	00:09:09.353	"But as the saying goes, <br> 'For every cloud, a silver lining.' We've got..."
00:09:09.440	00:09:10.920	"Hold on <br> right there, Buster."
00:09:10.960	00:09:13.793	"My dad, he heard I was gonna see <br> you today and he was all like,"
00:09:13.880	00:09:16.758	"'Eddie, you tell that koala I'm not <br> funding any more of those shows."
00:09:16.840	00:09:18.176	"'And that's final.' <br> Those were his words."
00:09:18.200	00:09:20.919	"Your dad's right. <br> Those shows were the problem."
00:09:21.000	00:09:22.956	"War of Attrition. <br> Rosie Takes a Bow."
00:09:23.080	00:09:24.920	"I mean, nobody wants <br> to see that stuff anymore."
00:09:25.000	00:09:26.228	"So, what do I do?"
00:09:26.640	00:09:28.198	"Quit? <br> No."
00:09:28.280	00:09:31.238	"I give them a show they cannot <br> resist, which is gonna be..."
00:09:31.320	00:09:32.320	"Ahem!"
00:09:32.360	00:09:34.157	"Just one more minute, <br> s'il vous plaît."
00:09:34.240	00:09:36.151	"Merci!"
00:09:36.480	00:09:38.436	"Don't speak French. <br> They speak English here."
00:09:38.640	00:09:40.596	"Now, my next show <br> is gonna be..."
00:09:40.680	00:09:41.908	"Drumroll, please."
00:09:43.560	00:09:45.471	"A singing competition!"
00:09:46.240	00:09:47.719	"A singing competition?"
00:09:48.040	00:09:49.456	"Who wants to see <br> another one of those?"
00:09:49.480	00:09:51.391	"Everyone! Just... <br> Just think."
00:09:51.480	00:09:55.439	"Your neighbor, the grocery store <br> manager, that chicken! Right there!"
00:09:55.520	00:09:58.592	"Everyone in this city <br> gets a shot at being a star"
00:09:58.680	00:10:00.159	"live on my stage!"
00:10:00.240	00:10:02.356	"Buster, this is <br> a terrible idea!"
00:10:02.520	00:10:03.748	"Oh! No, it's not!"
00:10:03.840	00:10:05.990	"Real talent from real life."
00:10:06.080	00:10:09.197	"That's what audiences want, <br> and I'm gonna give it to them!"
00:10:09.320	00:10:10.639	"All right, well..."
00:10:11.600	00:10:13.936	"Can we please just get <br> out of here? Don't you wanna eat?"
00:10:13.960	00:10:15.916	"Yeah, but we can't <br> afford any of this."
00:10:16.040	00:10:18.110	"Yes, I know, <br> and that's why..."
00:10:18.200	00:10:19.349	"I brought sandwiches."
00:10:19.440	00:10:23.069	"Uh, that's not allowed. <br> And... Ugh!"
00:10:23.200	00:10:24.696	"What, you don't like <br> peanut butter and jelly?"
00:10:24.720	00:10:25.835	"Excuse me, sir."
00:10:26.520	00:10:28.576	"Okay, look, I got cream cheese, <br> I got banana..."
00:10:33.680	00:10:34.680	"You okay?"
00:10:34.720	00:10:36.119	"Yup. Never better."
00:10:39.360	00:10:40.680	"Miss Crawly?"
00:10:41.640	00:10:43.198	"Hello?"
00:10:43.280	00:10:45.236	"Uh, who is it?"
00:10:45.400	00:10:46.674	"It's me."
00:10:46.760	00:10:48.352	"Your boss. Mr. Moon."
00:10:48.480	00:10:50.710	"Oh, hello, Mr. Moon. <br> There we go."
00:10:50.800	00:10:54.031	"Now, I need you to add the following <br> information to our publicity flyers."
00:10:54.120	00:10:55.120	"Yes, sir."
00:10:55.200	00:10:59.113	"The winner of the singing contest <br> will receive a grand prize of..."
00:11:00.080	00:11:02.640 <br> $935. <br>  <br> 00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.598	"Hmm. Gonna need more than that. <br> Just a second."
00:11:08.800	00:11:10.472	"Uh, there."
00:11:10.880	00:11:13.155 <br> $1,000. <br>  <br> 00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.511	"You got that? <br> "$1,000. <br>  <br> 00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.033 <br> "Oh!"
00:11:24.840	00:11:26.896	"Print them up on every <br> single sheet of paper we have left,"
00:11:26.920	00:11:29.354	"and let's spread the word <br> right away, okay?"
00:11:29.440	00:11:30.589	"Oh, yes, sir."
00:11:34.480	00:11:36.914	"Okay. Come on out of there."
00:11:44.120	00:11:47.317	"Ah, the winds of change."
00:11:47.440	00:11:51.194	"Yep, when this show's a hit, <br> I'm gonna get you a fresh coat of paint."
00:11:52.480	00:11:54.016	"How are we doing with those <br> flyers, Miss Crawly?"
00:11:54.040	00:11:57.112	"Oh, yes, sir. <br> We're all good to go here."
00:11:57.200	00:11:58.200	"Whoa..."
00:11:58.320	00:12:00.276	"Miss Crawly, no! No, no, no!"
00:12:01.600	00:12:02.874	"Oopsie-daisy."
00:12:02.960	00:12:05.952	"Well, I guess that's <br> one way to spread the word."
00:12:20.920	00:12:22.319	"Hey, Lance, look at this!"
00:12:22.800	00:12:23.994	"Ash, babe. Hey!"
00:12:38.120	00:12:39.160	"Meena!"
00:12:45.720	00:12:48.200	"Hey, hey, hey! <br> What do you think you're..."
00:12:50.160	00:12:51.559	"Uh-huh. Yeah."
00:13:12.040	00:13:13.393	"Ow. Mmm."
00:13:15.120	00:13:16.120	"Ah."
00:13:18.640	00:13:19.834	"Let's go to work!"
00:13:23.160	00:13:24.957	"And cue the crazy old lizard."
00:13:25.040	00:13:26.678	"Good morning, Mr. Moon."
00:13:26.760	00:13:29.479	"Indeed it is, Miss Crawly. <br> Top of the morning to you."
00:13:29.560	00:13:31.312	"I made you some coffee."
00:13:31.400	00:13:33.118	"You did? Where is it?"
00:13:33.240	00:13:36.789	"Oh. I got a little thirsty <br> on the way up those stairs."
00:13:37.400	00:13:40.278	"Shall I go open the doors now? <br> The doors?"
00:13:40.400	00:13:43.870	"You've got a lot of animals waiting <br> in line to audition, Mr. Moon."
00:13:43.960	00:13:44.995	"I do?"
00:13:47.600	00:13:49.750	"Holy moly, I really do."
00:13:53.160	00:13:55.310	"I swear to you, Eddie! <br> This is no joke!"
00:13:55.400	00:13:58.631	"Look, just get down here and <br> see for yourself! I gotta go."
00:13:58.800	00:14:00.279	"This is it, Miss Crawly!"
00:14:00.400	00:14:04.518	"Get your scaly tail downstairs <br> and throw those doors open wide!"
00:14:14.320	00:14:17.835	"Okay, um, one at a time, <br> please. Calm down."
00:14:39.960	00:14:41.280	"Bye, Iggy. Bye, Perry. <br> Bye, Carla."
00:14:41.400	00:14:42.719	"Bye, Gail. Bye, Rory. <br> Bye, Micky."
00:14:42.800	00:14:44.392	"Bye, Moe. Bye, Nelson. <br> Bye, Hannah."
00:14:44.480	00:14:46.436	"Bye, Tess. Bye-bye, Caspar."
00:14:46.640	00:14:47.640	"Phew!"
00:15:16.160	00:15:18.833	"Uh, let's hear from a few more <br> of the folks in line."
00:15:18.920	00:15:19.920	"What about you, sir?"
00:15:20.000	00:15:21.592	"Well, Bob, <br> I'm a lab technician"
00:15:21.680	00:15:23.193	"for a leading <br> pharmaceutical company,"
00:15:23.280	00:15:25.077	"but I was born with a gift."
00:15:25.160	00:15:26.991	"And that gift is to sing!"
00:16:06.960	00:16:08.632	"Oi, Dad! <br> Just going out."
00:16:08.720	00:16:11.234	"Well, don't be long. <br> I got the gang coming over."
00:16:17.280	00:16:18.633	"Look, I'm sure <br> you're gonna get"
00:16:18.720	00:16:20.016	"a lot of namby-pamby <br> animals in here,"
00:16:20.040	00:16:21.040	"saying things like,"
00:16:21.200	00:16:23.555	"'Oh, it's not winning. <br> It's the taking part that counts.'"
00:16:23.640	00:16:26.029	"Yeah, yeah. Not me, pal. <br> I'm here to win."
00:16:26.120	00:16:28.031	"That prize, it's mine!"
00:17:08.680	00:17:10.716	"Wow! Thank you, Johnny."
00:17:11.880	00:17:15.031	"Okay, next up we have Meena."
00:17:15.120	00:17:16.189	"Good luck out there."
00:17:16.280	00:17:17.896	"All right, come on. Here we go. <br> Come on, you can do it."
00:17:17.920	00:17:19.114	"You can do it. Okay."
00:17:19.200	00:17:21.430	"Oh, I'm sorry."
00:17:22.640	00:17:24.790	"Okay. Hey, it's all right. <br> You know, it's all right."
00:17:24.880	00:17:26.074	"Take it away, Meena!"
00:17:29.080	00:17:31.640	"Uh... Okay. Uh..."
00:17:32.440	00:17:33.793	"Anytime, now."
00:17:33.920	00:17:34.920	"Um..."
00:17:36.520	00:17:37.760	"Do you <br> wanna start over?"
00:17:37.800	00:17:39.552	"Um..."
00:17:39.640	00:17:41.776	"All right, enough of that! <br> That's quite enough of that."
00:17:41.800	00:17:42.869	"That's it. Come on."
00:17:42.960	00:17:44.154	"Off the stage, Helga."
00:17:44.440	00:17:46.158	"Go on, you're useless. <br> Thanks."
00:17:46.400	00:17:48.118	"Right. Here we go. <br> Hit it!"
00:18:41.040	00:18:44.476	"Okay, that's everyone, <br> Mr. Moon. Phew!"
00:18:44.600	00:18:47.478	"All right, call everyone back to stage, <br> Miss Crawly, and let's get..."
00:18:47.560	00:18:48.788	"Ohh!"
00:18:48.880	00:18:51.872	"Hello! Can I have everybody <br> back to stage, please?"
00:18:51.960	00:18:54.190	"Everyone come back <br> to stage for selection."
00:18:54.320	00:18:56.038	"Okay. Thank you, <br> Miss Crawly."
00:18:56.120	00:18:58.236	"You're welcome, Mr. Moon."
00:19:07.240	00:19:09.356	"All right. Let's see, now."
00:19:10.800	00:19:11.800	"Hmm."
00:19:15.360	00:19:20.388	"I'll take..."
00:19:20.480	00:19:21.708	"You guys."
00:19:22.400	00:19:23.616	"And which one of you <br> is the girl?"
00:19:23.640	00:19:25.153	"Ha-ha. Very funny."
00:19:25.240	00:19:28.232	"'Loud and horrible, <br> but shows promise.'"
00:19:28.600	00:19:29.999	"Welcome to the show."
00:19:30.080	00:19:31.593	"Cool. <br> I guess we could hang."
00:19:31.760	00:19:33.193	"No, no. <br> I just want her, not you."
00:19:33.280	00:19:34.280	"What? <br> What?"
00:19:34.480	00:19:37.074	"All right, the rest of the <br> group acts, thank you so much."
00:19:37.280	00:19:39.635	"Oh, don't feel bad, folks."
00:19:39.720	00:19:42.712	"There'll be a 10% discount <br> on tickets for everyone!"
00:19:42.800	00:19:43.869	"Yeah, sure, thanks a lot."
00:19:44.480	00:19:47.119	"Let's get <br> out of here, Ash."
00:19:47.760	00:19:48.875	"Ash?"
00:19:49.000	00:19:50.672	"Uh, yeah."
00:19:50.760	00:19:52.079	"Yeah, let's go."
00:19:52.760	00:19:54.591	"Okay, soloists!"
00:19:55.280	00:19:59.592	"Johnny, Mike, Pete, <br> Richard, Daniel and Ray."
00:20:01.000	00:20:03.355	"Mike! Wowza!"
00:20:03.440	00:20:04.839	"I've got to have you <br> in my show."
00:20:04.920	00:20:06.433	"Oh. If you insist."
00:20:06.520	00:20:07.953	"And I'll take Pete."
00:20:08.400	00:20:09.594	"Oh, yeah!"
00:20:09.680	00:20:11.079	"And one more."
00:20:12.160	00:20:13.479	"Let me see now."
00:20:13.560	00:20:15.551	"Oh, my gosh. <br> I am so sorry."
00:20:15.880	00:20:18.394	"What is wrong with me?"
00:20:18.680	00:20:21.319	"Whoo! Uh, <br> thanks for coming, Richard."
00:20:24.320	00:20:25.958	"Oh, my... Ray!"
00:20:26.600	00:20:27.715	"Are you all right?"
00:20:27.800	00:20:29.836	"Just hang in there, Ray. <br> I got you."
00:20:29.920	00:20:32.036	"Oh! Oh! Oops!"
00:20:33.960	00:20:36.394	"Okay, then I'll take..."
00:20:38.240	00:20:39.240	"Daniel."
00:20:39.320	00:20:40.376	"Thank you, Johnny."
00:20:40.400	00:20:42.311	"Daniel, can you hear me?"
00:20:42.480	00:20:43.879	"You're in the show!"
00:20:43.960	00:20:45.234	"What?"
00:20:45.320	00:20:46.799	"Are you talking to me?"
00:20:47.320	00:20:48.753	"Yes."
00:20:49.080	00:20:52.152	"I was saying <br> that you are in..."
00:20:52.520	00:20:54.556	"Oh, geez, this is gonna <br> drive me nuts. Johnny!"
00:20:54.680	00:20:56.238	"Get back here. You're in."
00:20:56.320	00:20:58.959	"Thank you, Daniel. Goodbye!"
00:20:59.040	00:21:00.040	"Yes!"
00:21:00.360	00:21:02.430	"Okay. <br> That's everyone on my list."
00:21:04.000	00:21:06.434	"Um, wait a second. Rosita."
00:21:06.520	00:21:07.953	"Is Rosita still here?"
00:21:08.040	00:21:09.598	"Yes! Yes, I'm here!"
00:21:09.760	00:21:12.194	"Rosita, Rosita, Rosita. <br> 'Great set of pipes,"
00:21:12.320	00:21:13.833	"'but boring to watch.'"
00:21:13.960	00:21:16.110	"I knew it."
00:21:16.240	00:21:17.753	"So, what should I do?"
00:21:17.880	00:21:21.395	"I could partner you up <br> with Gunter."
00:21:21.480	00:21:22.754	"Gunter! Where are you?"
00:21:23.360	00:21:25.510	"Ja! Ja! This is me."
00:21:27.680	00:21:30.194	"Ja!"
00:21:30.280	00:21:31.680	"It's gonna spice things up <br> on stage."
00:21:31.720	00:21:34.029	"Wait. You want us <br> to sing together?"
00:21:34.120	00:21:36.475	"Ja! The two of us together, <br> you joking me?"
00:21:36.560	00:21:38.994	"We're going to be spicy, no?"
00:21:40.080	00:21:42.310	"That koala's a fool, <br> Sherry-Anne!"
00:21:42.400	00:21:44.311	"You are gonna be <br> a star one day!"
00:21:44.400	00:21:47.597	"Auditions are over, pal. <br> Show's already been cast."
00:21:47.680	00:21:51.229	"Okay. <br> You are my chosen few."
00:21:51.320	00:21:52.548	"Yes!"
00:21:52.640	00:21:56.997	"This is it, folks! A defining <br> moment in all of our lives!"
00:21:57.240	00:21:58.240	"Um, no..."
00:21:58.360	00:22:00.936	"No, no, no. Not you guys. <br> I dismissed all of the group acts already."
00:22:00.960	00:22:02.029	"You can go home."
00:22:04.480	00:22:08.473	"Look, I'm really sorry, <br> but all of the slots are filled."
00:22:10.680	00:22:12.079	"No, no, listen!"
00:22:12.160	00:22:13.957	"No in show."
00:22:14.040	00:22:15.314	"Goodbye-bye!"
00:22:15.400	00:22:16.400	"Miss Crawly!"
00:22:16.520	00:22:18.476	"Come on, you guys! <br> Out of here."
00:22:18.600	00:22:20.238	"Come on. Off the stage."
00:22:20.320	00:22:21.833	"Thank you so much."
00:22:21.920	00:22:23.148	"Hey, Moon. <br> What's the story?"
00:22:23.240	00:22:24.720	"Is the prize <br> really inside this thing?"
00:22:24.800	00:22:27.075	"The prize? Oh, sure. <br> Yes, it's all in there."
00:22:27.480	00:22:30.438	"Open it, will ya? I wanna see <br> what $100.000 looks like."
00:22:30.560	00:22:32.736	"- Me, too! <br> - Yeah, go on. Open it, Mr. Moon."
00:22:32.760	00:22:33.875	"Sure, I'll open it."
00:22:34.360	00:22:36.351	"Wait. <br> What did you say?"
00:22:36.440	00:22:38.431	"He said $100.000."
00:22:39.720	00:22:41.039	"A hundred..."
00:22:41.680	00:22:43.193	"Uh..."
00:22:44.480	00:22:46.198	"I forgot my keys."
00:22:46.280	00:22:47.474	"Koala be right back."
00:22:50.760	00:22:54.719	"For the last time, Miss Crawly, <br> I'm not going to fire you!"
00:22:54.800	00:22:56.176	"Now would you <br> pull yourself together"
00:22:56.200	00:22:58.270	"and please blow <br> that nose of yours."
00:22:59.480	00:23:01.755	"No, no, no. Not in here. <br> Blow it outside."
00:23:01.840	00:23:02.875	"I'm sorry. <br> Thank you."
00:23:02.960	00:23:05.190	"Buster, what do you expect? <br> She's, like, 200 years old."
00:23:05.320	00:23:08.676	"Eddie, please. Look, if your folks <br> could just loan me the money until..."
00:23:08.760	00:23:12.150 <br> $100.000? Buster, come on! <br>  <br> 00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.616	"I got to think, <br> I've got to think,"
00:23:13.640	00:23:14.834	"I've got to think."
00:23:14.960	00:23:19.317	"Look, maybe it's time to stop thinking, <br> and it's time to just move on."
00:23:19.400	00:23:22.995	"I mean, this theater of yours, you could <br> get some decent money for it and..."
00:23:23.160	00:23:25.096	"I don't know, maybe we could <br> do something together."
00:23:25.120	00:23:27.918	"What? What, sit around <br> playing video games?"
00:23:29.280	00:23:31.111	"Do you know what that is?"
00:23:31.200	00:23:32.235	"Uh, it's a bucket?"
00:23:32.320	00:23:34.515	"Yes, and do you know <br> why I have this bucket?"
00:23:34.640	00:23:35.696	"Because the roof <br> is leaking?"
00:23:35.720	00:23:37.756	"No, that's the bucket <br> for the leak."
00:23:37.840	00:23:40.832	"I have this one because <br> it belonged to my father."
00:23:41.480	00:23:42.674	"Every day for 30 years,"
00:23:42.760	00:23:44.990	"he worked his tail off <br> washing cars"
00:23:45.080	00:23:46.957	"just so I could <br> buy this place."
00:23:48.000	00:23:49.672	"Every day, Eddie."
00:23:50.160	00:23:51.878	"Just for me."
00:23:51.960	00:23:54.838	"Wow. Sounds like <br> a great dad."
00:23:57.320	00:23:58.958	"So how do you <br> wanna handle this?"
00:24:00.520	00:24:05.674	"Uh, Mr. Moon, I got Judith <br> from the bank holding on line two again."
00:24:09.200	00:24:10.680	"Well, there's only <br> one thing I can do."
00:24:12.160	00:24:13.673	"Okay, everybody, listen up!"
00:24:13.720	00:24:16.439	"I gotta send you all home. <br> Right now."
00:24:16.760	00:24:17.760	"Huh? <br> What?"
00:24:17.840	00:24:20.718	"Yep. 'Cause like my dad <br> used to say,"
00:24:20.800	00:24:23.712	"'Get a good night's sleep <br> and do a great day's work!'"
00:24:26.640	00:24:30.315	"That's right. Rehearsals begin <br> first thing tomorrow morning."
00:24:30.400	00:24:32.709	"And if you wanna become stars <br> and win 100 grand,"
00:24:32.800	00:24:36.349	"then you better be ready to work harder <br> than you've ever worked in your lives."
00:24:36.560	00:24:39.916	"So, get some sleep, <br> and dream big dreams!"
00:24:41.240	00:24:42.720	"- Blimey! <br> - This is great!"
00:24:44.600	00:24:45.635	"Miss Crawly!"
00:24:47.720	00:24:50.632	"Come on, that's enough now. <br> Come on, off the stage. Please."
00:24:50.720	00:24:51.835	"'Dream big dreams'?"
00:24:51.920	00:24:52.920	"I know, it's good, right?"
00:24:53.000	00:24:54.069	"What about the 100 grand?"
00:24:54.160	00:24:57.038	"Don't you worry, Eddie. <br> There's got to be a way to get it."
00:24:57.120	00:24:58.951	"What? Buster, no, <br> listen to me!"
00:24:59.320	00:25:00.469	"This show is not gonna"
00:25:00.600	00:25:01.749	"save your theater."
00:25:01.840	00:25:03.478	"You're at rock bottom, pal."
00:25:03.560	00:25:06.597	"Yep, and do you know what's great <br> about hitting rock bottom, Eddie?"
00:25:06.720	00:25:10.998	"There's only one way <br> left to go. And that's up!"
00:25:14.760	00:25:18.150	"And you can see the lucky few <br> leaving the theater behind me."
00:25:18.240	00:25:20.216	"Now back to you in the studio, John..."
00:25:20.240	00:25:22.993	"Oh, honey, please don't cry."
00:25:23.080	00:25:24.593	"You are not a failure."
00:25:24.680	00:25:26.352	"There'll be other chances, <br> you just..."
00:25:26.440	00:25:28.192	"Bah! The heck, there will!"
00:25:28.280	00:25:29.508	"Dad, please..."
00:25:29.600	00:25:31.591	"Come on! <br> Don't you want this?"
00:25:31.680	00:25:33.352	"Well, sure, <br> but I messed it up."
00:25:33.440	00:25:35.874	"Then you gotta go back <br> there tomorrow and say,"
00:25:35.960	00:25:38.997	"'Mr. Moon, I demand you <br> let me re-audition!'"
00:25:39.080	00:25:41.674	"Be confident! Show 'em you <br> ain't gonna be pushed around!"
00:25:41.760	00:25:44.069	"You got that, Meena? <br> Um..."
00:25:44.160	00:25:46.549	"Good! Now go get my cocoa."
00:25:48.080	00:25:50.958	"I won't sell out for nobody"
00:25:51.480	00:25:53.948	"Won't follow no fool"
00:25:54.040	00:25:56.713	"Would you stop? <br> I'd only be doing it for us."
00:25:56.800	00:25:57.800	"Oh, really?"
00:25:57.840	00:26:00.195	"Yes, really! <br> If I won that money,"
00:26:00.280	00:26:02.919	"we could build our own recording <br> studio, start our own label."
00:26:03.040	00:26:05.429	"I mean, the whole world <br> would get to hear your songs."
00:26:05.520	00:26:08.034	"I'm not listening <br> to my girlfriend"
00:26:08.160	00:26:11.709	"'Cause she just wants <br> to sell out"
00:26:19.840	00:26:20.909	"Ah..."
00:26:38.760	00:26:39.875	"Hey! Just a minute."
00:26:39.960	00:26:40.960	"Oh, wait. Wait!"
00:26:43.680	00:26:44.680	"Aw, look at..."
00:26:44.760	00:26:46.830	"I know Derek, the manager. <br> He'll vouch for me!"
00:26:46.920	00:26:47.955	"Come on!"
00:26:48.440	00:26:49.509	"Hey, Mario!"
00:26:50.560	00:26:51.879	"How's it going?"
00:26:52.440	00:26:53.714	"Oh, for crying out loud!"
00:26:54.320	00:26:55.594	"Yeah, let the bears in."
00:26:55.840	00:26:57.273	"Let the bears in. Fine."
00:27:00.960	00:27:02.518	"There he is!"
00:27:02.800	00:27:05.314	"I got a surprise <br> for you, my son."
00:27:06.400	00:27:08.197	"What's that? <br> Tell him the plan."
00:27:08.280	00:27:09.280	"Right."
00:27:09.680	00:27:12.717	"We've been told there's a ship <br> carrying $25 million in gold"
00:27:12.800	00:27:14.313	"gonna dock at night <br> right here."
00:27:14.400	00:27:17.631	"With the usual guards <br> here and here."
00:27:17.720	00:27:21.269	"But lucky for us, there's <br> a sewer right under here."
00:27:21.360	00:27:24.033	"So, the getaway driver <br> meets us here."
00:27:24.200	00:27:27.715	"And that is gonna be you <br> this time, Johnny."
00:27:27.880	00:27:30.235	"What? You want, <br> you want me to drive?"
00:27:30.360	00:27:33.193	"Yeah. It's time my boy had a <br> proper role in the gang, eh?"
00:27:33.600	00:27:34.874	"Hang on, hang on, Dad."
00:27:34.960	00:27:36.160	"Barry's always <br> been our driver."
00:27:36.240	00:27:38.390	"Barry don't mind. <br> Do you, Barry?"
00:27:39.760	00:27:42.069	"No. No, that's fine. <br> Yeah."
00:27:42.240	00:27:44.959	"So, when exactly <br> is this ship comin' in then?"
00:27:45.040	00:27:46.155	"We ain't got a date yet."
00:27:46.240	00:27:47.656	"Probably won't be for <br> a while though, will it?"
00:27:47.680	00:27:48.829	"What do you care?"
00:27:48.920	00:27:50.558	"It's the last job <br> we ever need to do."
00:27:50.640	00:27:53.108	"When it comes in, <br> we go. Right?"
00:27:53.480	00:27:54.480	"Great."
00:27:54.760	00:27:55.954	"Can't wait."
00:27:57.360	00:27:59.157	"Um, hi, I saw your ad <br> in the paper."
00:27:59.280	00:28:01.999	"Yes, I need a nanny, <br> just for a couple of weeks."
00:28:02.080	00:28:03.832	"You can? Great!"
00:28:04.720	00:28:08.235	"The kids? Yes, they're wonderful. <br> Yeah, I have 25."
00:28:08.960	00:28:10.916	"No, I'm not joking."
00:28:11.040	00:28:12.553	"Um, but they're really <br> no problem..."
00:28:12.920	00:28:14.558	"Hello? Hello?"
00:28:14.640	00:28:16.119	"Good night, Mommy."
00:28:19.280	00:28:21.157	"Hey! How was the big meeting?"
00:28:22.560	00:28:24.073	"That bad, really?"
00:28:24.480	00:28:27.199	"Oh, I have something <br> really exciting to tell you..."
00:28:27.280	00:28:29.271	"Mmm. You make <br> the best pie, honey."
00:28:29.440	00:28:31.112	"Listen, Norman, <br> I know it's short notice,"
00:28:31.200	00:28:33.360	"but I could really use some <br> help with the kids tomorrow"
00:28:33.480	00:28:36.552	"because, well, you are not going <br> to believe what I did today."
00:28:38.080	00:28:40.548	"Norman, are you <br> listening to me?"
00:28:48.080	00:28:50.833	"Rehearsals begin first <br> thing tomorrow morning,"
00:28:50.920	00:28:54.435	"so get some sleep, <br> and dream big dreams!"
00:28:54.520	00:28:56.192	"Dreams, dreams!"
00:28:56.280	00:28:57.349	"Hmm."
00:29:22.280	00:29:23.736	"Good morning, everybody."
00:29:23.760	00:29:25.910	"Now, I want you <br> all dressed before breakfast."
00:29:31.080	00:29:32.433	"Breakfast!"
00:29:36.520	00:29:38.875	"Rosita, have you seen <br> my car keys?"
00:29:39.040	00:29:41.240	"Don't forget, <br> your keys are in your coat pocket."
00:29:41.320	00:29:43.470	"Oh, I found 'em. <br> Bye, honey."
00:29:43.560	00:29:44.709	"Bye, Norman."
00:29:46.280	00:29:47.508	"Time for school!"
00:29:49.520	00:29:50.520	"Bye, Iggy. Bye, Perry."
00:29:50.720	00:29:53.314	"Bye, Carla. Bye, Gail. Bye, Rory. <br> Bye, Micky. Bye, Moe."
00:29:53.400	00:29:54.879	"Bye, Nelson. Bye, Hannah. <br> Bye, Tess."
00:29:54.960	00:29:56.439	"Bye, Kelly. Bye, George. <br> Bye, Andy."
00:29:56.520	00:29:58.238	"Bye, Freddy. Bye-bye, Caspar."
00:30:05.160	00:30:07.037	"This contest is war!"
00:30:07.600	00:30:12.674	"This stage is the battlefield. <br> Your song is your weapon."
00:30:12.920	00:30:15.718	"Now you only get one shot <br> to blow that audience away,"
00:30:15.800	00:30:19.315	"so choose carefully from the list of <br> songs I've selected for each of you."
00:30:19.400	00:30:21.994	"Ah, talked some sense <br> into that boyfriend of yours?"
00:30:22.080	00:30:25.390	"Lance is an artist, but I wouldn't <br> expect you to understand that."
00:30:25.480	00:30:27.096	"You're right. I don't <br> understand that at all."
00:30:27.120	00:30:32.114	"Now, you'll notice each list also includes <br> my costume and performance suggestions."
00:30:32.200	00:30:33.758	"Okay? Miss Crawly <br> will show you"
00:30:33.840	00:30:34.955	"to your rehearsal spaces."
00:30:35.040	00:30:36.314	"Now, let's get to work!"
00:30:36.400	00:30:37.799	"Excuse me, Mr. Moon?"
00:30:37.880	00:30:40.678	"For some reason, it says here that <br> I should be playing the piano?"
00:30:40.760	00:30:43.718	"Yes, just imagine, big, <br> soulful guy like you"
00:30:43.800	00:30:45.153	"tenderly playing the keys."
00:30:45.280	00:30:46.600	"There'll be goosebumps <br> everywhere!"
00:30:46.640	00:30:48.456	"Well, I haven't played piano <br> since I was a kid."
00:30:48.480	00:30:49.708	"Miss Crawly! We're gonna need"
00:30:49.800	00:30:50.896	"some piano lessons over here."
00:30:50.920	00:30:53.195	"Yes, sir! Up the stairs, <br> I'll be right along."
00:30:53.280	00:30:54.508	"And, Pete, you're in here."
00:30:54.600	00:30:56.158	"You got it, Mr. Moon."
00:30:57.480	00:30:58.515	"Check your ego, man!"
00:30:58.600	00:31:00.360	"Hey, hey, hey, hey, <br> break it up, break it up."
00:31:00.440	00:31:02.351	"Oh, yeah? Tell Ricki! <br> He started it!"
00:31:02.440	00:31:06.035	"That's right! Just like I started <br> this band! My band, Howie!"
00:31:06.120	00:31:08.076	"Oh, forgive me, <br> your highness!"
00:31:08.160	00:31:09.388	"Guys, come on! <br> No, no!"
00:31:09.800	00:31:11.677	"Hey! Get out! <br> Get out of here!"
00:31:19.480	00:31:22.790	"Look, just calm down <br> and pick a song."
00:31:23.000	00:31:25.120	"I think we'll probably have <br> a better chance of winning"
00:31:25.200	00:31:28.078	"if I do the singing part and <br> leave the dancing part to you."
00:31:28.160	00:31:29.878	"Bah! Are you joking me?"
00:31:29.960	00:31:32.679	"You are just in need of, <br> like, a super cool warm-up."
00:31:33.040	00:31:35.190	"Come on! Let's take off <br> these clothes!"
00:31:35.280	00:31:37.240	"That, that is not necessary."
00:31:38.240	00:31:40.231	"Oh! That is a lot of skin."
00:31:41.920	00:31:45.196	"Ah, don't you look so worried face! <br> I've got one for you, too!"
00:31:46.040	00:31:47.678	"Hey, porky! <br> Keep it down, will ya!"
00:31:47.840	00:31:48.840	"Sorry."
00:31:49.240	00:31:51.037	"Hey, Moon, you gave me <br> the wrong list."
00:31:51.200	00:31:53.270	"Cheesy pop's <br> not exactly my style."
00:31:53.360	00:31:55.999	"Style! I'm glad you brought that up. <br> Now, let's see..."
00:31:56.320	00:31:57.320	"There."
00:31:57.400	00:31:59.152	"Isn't this a great <br> color for you?"
00:31:59.240	00:32:02.755	"I can't tell. It's melting my eyes. <br> You got anything in black?"
00:32:02.840	00:32:05.559	"Black? What, you want everyone to <br> think you're going to a funeral?"
00:32:05.640	00:32:08.154	"You think you're some kind of <br> artsy-fartsy type? No, no, no."
00:32:08.280	00:32:10.714	"Bingo! Pop star princess!"
00:32:12.080	00:32:13.229	"Wait, what happened?"
00:32:13.480	00:32:14.754	"Is this part <br> of the competition?"
00:32:14.960	00:32:17.269	"Okay, everybody, don't panic. <br> Don't panic."
00:32:17.360	00:32:18.816	"What's going on? <br> Talk to me, Crawly."
00:32:18.840	00:32:22.230	"When did we last pay <br> the power company, Mr. Moon?"
00:32:22.440	00:32:23.759	"Oh, for Pete's sake."
00:32:24.360	00:32:25.679	"Okay, don't worry, <br> everybody."
00:32:25.880	00:32:27.074	"I will take care of this."
00:32:27.160	00:32:29.754	"In the meantime, you will <br> continue to rehearse in the dark."
00:32:30.040	00:32:31.951	"What? <br> But I can't see anything."
00:32:32.040	00:32:34.508	"Don't you worry, Rosita. <br> I have glow sticks."
00:32:35.200	00:32:36.633	"Great! Use this time"
00:32:36.720	00:32:39.439	"to shake off those first day <br> inhibitions, and I'll be right back."
00:32:39.880	00:32:40.936	"You got to <br> be kidding me."
00:32:40.960	00:32:43.030	"Okay, you heard him. <br> Back to work now!"
00:32:43.120	00:32:44.758	"Come on, everybody."
00:32:58.280	00:33:00.475	"Sorry, old girl. <br> I'll fix that."
00:33:10.720	00:33:12.472	"Hey. <br> Mr. Moon?"
00:33:14.080	00:33:17.834	"You probably don't remember me, <br> but I auditioned yesterday and I..."
00:33:17.920	00:33:19.035	"Hey, listen."
00:33:19.240	00:33:21.629	"Do you think, maybe, <br> you could reach the ledge?"
00:33:22.240	00:33:23.389	"That ledge?"
00:33:23.840	00:33:25.432	"Whoa-oh!"
00:33:25.520	00:33:27.160	"That's a heck of a trunk <br> you've got there!"
00:33:27.320	00:33:28.594	"Thanks a lot, kid!"
00:33:28.680	00:33:30.875	"Uh, Mr. Moon?"
00:33:31.560	00:33:34.358	"My name is Meena, <br> and I baked a cake for you"
00:33:34.440	00:33:37.989	"and, uh, I was wondering if you'd, <br> maybe, give me a second chance to..."
00:33:38.120	00:33:39.189	"Just a moment, please."
00:33:41.240	00:33:42.559	"Be right with you."
00:33:45.120	00:33:46.155	"Hmm."
00:33:55.240	00:33:58.152	"Yay! It's about time."
00:33:58.240	00:34:00.356	"Johnny..."
00:34:00.480	00:34:02.152	"Yep, mind your head here."
00:34:02.240	00:34:03.958	"Hey, can you pull up <br> that scenic cable?"
00:34:04.040	00:34:05.792	"You mean this? <br> Yes, that's it!"
00:34:09.280	00:34:11.635	"Great. <br> And the house lights?"
00:34:16.640	00:34:17.675	"Wow."
00:34:17.760	00:34:20.149	"Oh, I know. <br> Beautiful, isn't she?"
00:34:21.480	00:34:22.480	"You know what, kid?"
00:34:22.520	00:34:24.280	"How would you like to be <br> a part of this show?"
00:34:24.400	00:34:26.277	"Really? Wait, oh, my gosh,"
00:34:26.360	00:34:27.713	"I was just gonna <br> ask about that."
00:34:27.960	00:34:30.155	"Great! Because I could <br> really use a stagehand."
00:34:31.560	00:34:33.437	"Stagehand? But..."
00:34:33.840	00:34:36.149	"Don't worry about it. <br> You're gonna pick it up in no time."
00:34:36.240	00:34:37.992	"I'll teach you everything <br> I know. Follow me."
00:34:39.320	00:34:41.136	"These are the rehearsal <br> spaces and dressing rooms"
00:34:41.160	00:34:43.469	"and up here, we got workshops <br> and the main office."
00:34:43.600	00:34:45.192	"Up in the air! <br> Touch your toes!"
00:34:58.200	00:34:59.428	"Awesome!"
00:34:59.520	00:35:00.589	"Awesome?"
00:35:00.720	00:35:02.950	"Yeah, I think the <br> word you're after is 'awful.'"
00:35:03.040	00:35:05.270	"And that's me <br> restraining myself."
00:35:05.440	00:35:08.000	"There's not an ounce of talent <br> between them. Not an ounce."
00:35:08.080	00:35:09.195	"In fact, you know what?"
00:35:09.280	00:35:11.510	"I think that prize <br> is as good as mine already."
00:35:16.360	00:35:20.592	"Yes, indeed. I am about to come into <br> a very, very large sum of money."
00:35:20.720	00:35:22.870 <br> $100.000 to be precise. <br>  <br> 00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:24.599	"Well, is that so?"
00:35:24.680	00:35:27.558	"In that case, sir, you'll be <br> wanting our platinum card."
00:35:47.840	00:35:49.751	"Well, well, well... <br> Hello again."
00:35:57.560	00:36:00.870	"Oh, man, these are like the <br> cheesiest songs of all time."
00:36:00.960	00:36:02.188	"I know, right?"
00:36:02.280	00:36:05.033	"I mean, I was even thinking of <br> writing my own song instead."
00:36:05.200	00:36:08.556	"Wait, what? Your own song?"
00:36:08.640	00:36:09.675	"Well, yeah."
00:36:09.760	00:36:11.273	"Look, if you wanna <br> win that money,"
00:36:11.400	00:36:13.516	"just do what the koala says."
00:36:13.600	00:36:15.716	"Why? You think <br> I can't write my own song?"
00:36:15.800	00:36:17.631	"Whoa, whoa! <br> I'm just saying."
00:36:17.720	00:36:19.836	"Not everyone <br> can write songs, okay?"
00:36:20.400	00:36:23.676	"I know I make it look easy, babe. <br> But it's not."
00:36:29.160	00:36:33.278	"Oh, here she is! <br> Quiet down, everybody."
00:36:35.080	00:36:37.753	"So, Meena! <br> Are you in the show?"
00:36:38.840	00:36:41.195	"Uh, well, yeah. Kinda. But..."
00:36:42.880	00:36:44.056	"I knew it! I knew it!"
00:36:44.080	00:36:45.559	"She did it!"
00:36:45.680	00:36:47.955	"Oh, I'm so proud of you! <br> I could pop!"
00:36:48.120	00:36:50.350	"That's my birthday wish <br> coming true right there!"
00:36:50.440	00:36:51.509	"Way to go, Meena!"
00:36:51.640	00:36:53.119	"Oh, Meena, we love you!"
00:36:53.200	00:36:54.997	"Mom! <br> What the heck?"
00:36:55.080	00:36:56.696	"Wait a minute, wait a minute. <br> Don't be mad, okay?"
00:36:56.720	00:36:59.871	"It was your Grandma. She told the <br> whole street about your audition."
00:36:59.960	00:37:01.712	"Mom, no, wait. <br> Shush, baby."
00:37:01.800	00:37:04.234	"You need to save that <br> singing voice of yours."
00:37:04.320	00:37:08.916	"So, from now on, just nod <br> or shake your head, okay?"
00:37:18.640	00:37:19.709	"How was that, Dad?"
00:37:19.840	00:37:21.796	"You're still too soft <br> on 'em corners, Johnny."
00:37:22.400	00:37:23.696	"You got to attack 'em."
00:37:23.720	00:37:25.278	"And you're crunchin' <br> the gears."
00:37:25.360	00:37:27.430	"I told you, you got to be <br> gentle with the..."
00:37:27.520	00:37:30.478	"Look, turn that down. <br> Oi!"
00:37:30.640	00:37:32.312	"Listen to your father!"
00:37:33.000	00:37:34.752	"'Too soft on <br> the corners, Johnny.'"
00:37:36.480	00:37:39.392	"'You're not doin' it right, <br> Johnny. Speed up, Johnny.'"
00:37:42.120	00:37:43.348	"'Do it like I showed you...'"
00:37:43.520	00:37:44.999	"Whoa!"
00:37:52.560	00:37:53.788	"Dad?"
00:37:53.880	00:37:55.677	"Oh, no, I've run over my dad."
00:37:57.720	00:37:59.278	"Now, that is <br> more like it."
00:38:14.440	00:38:19.230	"And the three <br> little pigs lived happily ever after."
00:38:19.320	00:38:20.912	"Good night, my dears."
00:38:26.840	00:38:29.354	"Norman, are you awake?"
00:38:31.000	00:38:32.558	"How was your day, honey?"
00:38:32.920	00:38:35.480	"Same as always."
00:38:36.160	00:38:37.957	"It was? <br> Mmm-hmm."
00:38:38.640	00:38:42.235	"I don't know how <br> you do it all, honey."
00:38:42.360	00:38:44.555	"Good night."
00:39:02.000	00:39:04.594	"All creatures <br> great and small,"
00:39:05.160	00:39:07.754	"welcome to the Moon Theater!"
00:39:17.880	00:39:18.995	"Mr. Moon?"
00:39:19.800	00:39:21.756	"I have Judith <br> from the bank."
00:39:22.240	00:39:24.576	"What? Oh, no, no. Tell her I'll <br> call her back in the morning."
00:39:24.600	00:39:26.113	"I can't."
00:39:26.200	00:39:27.428	"She's right here."
00:39:30.960	00:39:33.030	"Judith! Hello!"
00:39:33.440	00:39:36.034	"I work for a bank, <br> not a charity."
00:39:36.120	00:39:38.376	"And if your accounts are not <br> settled by the end of the month..."
00:39:38.400	00:39:39.469	"Okay. Judith..."
00:39:39.640	00:39:42.950	"I personally guarantee by the end of <br> this month this show is going to be"
00:39:43.120	00:39:45.315	"the biggest hit this city <br> has ever seen!"
00:39:45.400	00:39:47.391	"Mr. Moon, none of your <br> shows have ever worked."
00:39:47.480	00:39:48.480	"None of them!"
00:39:48.640	00:39:50.073	"You've had your chances."
00:39:50.200	00:39:54.398	"Now settle your accounts or we <br> will repossess this property!"
00:39:54.520	00:39:56.238	"Okay. Toodle-oo."
00:39:59.520	00:40:01.988	"What are you gonna do, <br> Mr. Moon?"
00:40:02.280	00:40:03.713	"Honestly..."
00:40:03.800	00:40:06.837	"Uh, I have no idea."
00:40:35.040	00:40:36.439	"Are you wearing <br> a Speedo, Eddie?"
00:40:36.600	00:40:37.794	"What are you..."
00:40:37.880	00:40:40.110	"Eddie, <br> is everything all right?"
00:40:40.280	00:40:42.669	"Yeah, uh, just doing <br> my laps, Ma!"
00:40:44.680	00:40:47.353	"So, what, you live <br> in the pool house now?"
00:40:47.440	00:40:50.671	"Yeah, my folks want me <br> to be more, you know,"
00:40:50.800	00:40:52.313	"independent, I guess."
00:40:52.880	00:40:55.030	"They even hooked me up <br> with this life coach dude."
00:40:55.120	00:40:57.076	"Life coach? <br> Yeah."
00:40:57.160	00:40:59.628	"I guess he's gonna help me <br> find my purpose in life."
00:40:59.720	00:41:00.720	"I thought I had one,"
00:41:00.800	00:41:04.349	"but, turns out, it wasn't <br> the right one or something?"
00:41:04.480	00:41:05.549	"I don't know."
00:41:05.720	00:41:08.792	"Anyway, he's got me <br> on this whole schedule thing."
00:41:08.880	00:41:10.711	"It's like, Mondays, <br> take out the recycling."
00:41:10.800	00:41:13.360	"Tuesdays, mow the lawn. <br> Wednesdays, go visit Nana."
00:41:13.440	00:41:14.589	"Thursdays, clean the pool."
00:41:14.680	00:41:16.696	"It's like, don't we have <br> people to do all this stuff?"
00:41:16.720	00:41:18.517	"Whoa, whoa. Back up."
00:41:18.600	00:41:20.272	"Your nana is still alive?"
00:41:20.360	00:41:21.395	"Oh, yeah."
00:41:26.560	00:41:27.629	"Wow."
00:41:27.720	00:41:28.835	"And she's rich, right?"
00:41:29.120	00:41:30.155	"She's loaded."
00:41:30.240	00:41:33.630	"But trust me, you don't <br> wanna go near my nana."
00:41:35.040	00:41:36.917	"She is one mean sheep."
00:41:51.160	00:41:52.593	"Now fade up the spot."
00:41:56.040	00:41:57.553	"Good. Lower the moon."
00:41:57.720	00:41:59.039	"Coffee? <br> Thank you, Miss Crawly."
00:42:00.880	00:42:04.236	"Okay, that's normal. <br> Just needs a knock."
00:42:05.160	00:42:06.434	"See? You're getting it."
00:42:12.280	00:42:13.998	"Anyone seen my glass eye?"
00:42:14.560	00:42:16.630	"The darn thing <br> keeps popping out."
00:42:20.280	00:42:21.280	"Whoa!"
00:42:24.520	00:42:25.520	"Oh!"
00:42:27.360	00:42:28.839	"You almost killed me, Jumbo!"
00:42:29.000	00:42:30.035	"It wasn't me."
00:42:30.200	00:42:31.553	"Oh, is that so?"
00:42:34.760	00:42:37.035	"Pete?"
00:42:39.800	00:42:41.631	"Pete, you're gonna be <br> all right, okay?"
00:42:41.760	00:42:43.239	"Just hang in there, buddy."
00:42:45.240	00:42:47.310	"Ricki? Kai?"
00:42:47.400	00:42:48.799	"Why aren't you guys <br> rehearsing?"
00:42:48.920	00:42:50.148	"We're through!"
00:42:50.240	00:42:52.629	"They said I'm an <br> intolerable egomaniac."
00:42:53.160	00:42:55.799	"I don't even know <br> what that means!"
00:42:57.520	00:42:59.476	"All right. <br> We're two acts down."
00:42:59.680	00:43:01.557	"Give me some <br> good news, Miss Crawly."
00:43:01.880	00:43:04.075	"Oh, it's not as bad <br> as it looks."
00:43:06.800	00:43:08.597	"Oopsie-daisy."
00:43:08.680	00:43:10.800	"Meena, how would you like <br> to re-audition for the show?"
00:43:11.120	00:43:13.156	"Really? Well, yeah."
00:43:13.240	00:43:14.434	"Great! <br> I mean, no."
00:43:14.520	00:43:15.520	"What?"
00:43:15.800	00:43:17.552	"I mean, yes, I can sing."
00:43:17.640	00:43:21.189	"But, no, I get so nervous <br> and I can't do it."
00:43:21.280	00:43:23.510	"I mean, I would <br> totally do it, but..."
00:43:23.600	00:43:24.999	"No, I... No."
00:43:25.800	00:43:27.199	"I'm gonna take that <br> as a maybe."
00:43:29.400	00:43:30.833	"Great! Look, they're back!"
00:43:31.000	00:43:32.558	"We're gonna come back <br> to this, Meena."
00:43:35.000	00:43:36.638	"Listen, guys, forget <br> what I said before."
00:43:36.720	00:43:38.790	"You are very talented."
00:43:38.880	00:43:40.552	"Please, join the show. Okay?"
00:43:41.280	00:43:42.918	"Yes? No?"
00:43:43.360	00:43:44.793	"Oh, um..."
00:43:45.280	00:43:46.349	"Here..."
00:43:56.720	00:43:59.871	"What? Hey, no! <br> Wait, wait, wait! Don't go!"
00:44:04.040	00:44:05.234	"Oh. What is this for?"
00:44:05.800	00:44:08.030	"Now, we use this <br> to follow the steps."
00:44:20.120	00:44:21.712	"Caspar! Caspar! No!"
00:44:21.800	00:44:23.074	"How about this? Ha-ha!"
00:44:23.240	00:44:24.468	"Come on! What did I tell you?"
00:44:24.680	00:44:28.036	"I'm so sorry, he had a fever and it <br> was too late to get a sitter, so..."
00:44:28.120	00:44:29.896	"Well, you seem fine now!"
00:44:29.920	00:44:30.989	"Wow!"
00:44:33.040	00:44:34.678	"Stop! <br> You're messing it up!"
00:44:34.760	00:44:35.909	"Hey!"
00:44:37.200	00:44:39.316	"I am not singing this."
00:44:39.480	00:44:40.549	"What's not to like?"
00:44:40.640	00:44:42.358	"You're a female <br> and you're a teenager."
00:44:42.440	00:44:43.555	"This song was made for you."
00:44:43.840	00:44:45.760	"Wow. <br> It's like you can see inside"
00:44:45.800	00:44:47.074	"my tiny teenage mind."
00:44:47.200	00:44:48.315	"I know, right?"
00:44:48.400	00:44:51.392	"You just gotta add some moves <br> and a little bit of..."
00:44:59.200	00:45:00.200	"Go for it!"
00:45:00.360	00:45:01.918	"Oh, you mean like this?"
00:45:07.320	00:45:09.436	"There you go! <br> You're a natural!"
00:45:15.800	00:45:17.950	"Yes, that was very bad."
00:45:18.120	00:45:19.320	"Johnny?"
00:45:19.840	00:45:20.955	"Come in. Over."
00:45:21.120	00:45:22.678	"Oh, Johnny, <br> your jacket's talking."
00:45:22.840	00:45:24.398	"Johnny, where are you?"
00:45:24.560	00:45:26.357	"Dad, what's going on? Over."
00:45:27.240	00:45:28.656	"What do you mean <br> you gotta leave now?"
00:45:28.680	00:45:30.318	"I know. I'm so sorry."
00:45:30.400	00:45:31.816	"It's just that I've got <br> this family business thing."
00:45:31.840	00:45:34.479	"Do I need to start worrying about <br> your commitment here, Johnny?"
00:45:34.560	00:45:36.232	"Tell me no. <br> No. Absolutely not."
00:45:36.320	00:45:37.336	"I promise it won't <br> happen again."
00:45:37.360	00:45:39.112	"It better not. <br> Thank you, Mr. Moon."
00:45:42.320	00:45:43.833	"Baby, I'm back."
00:45:53.240	00:45:54.753	"What is going on here?"
00:45:57.160	00:45:59.355	"Hi, I'm Becky."
00:45:59.640	00:46:00.709	"Becky?"
00:46:01.360	00:46:03.999	"Hey, what did you expect? <br> You're never around anymore."
00:46:04.080	00:46:06.514	"I did it for us, Lance!"
00:46:06.680	00:46:08.796	"You and me!"
00:46:08.920	00:46:10.512	"Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry."
00:46:10.680	00:46:12.671	"I think I left <br> my sunglasses in there."
00:46:15.560	00:46:18.074	"Come on, Becky. <br> Let's get out of here."
00:46:32.360	00:46:34.078	"Jackpot, baby! <br> Whoo-hoo!"
00:46:34.920	00:46:37.115	"Well, I say we call it <br> a night there, fellas."
00:46:37.360	00:46:39.794	"Hey, put the cash in my car, <br> will you, Derek?"
00:46:41.880	00:46:44.633	"Well, you're one great <br> card player, Mike."
00:46:44.920	00:46:46.433	"Not so bad yourself."
00:46:47.480	00:46:50.358	"Except, I still can't tell <br> how you cheated."
00:46:50.520	00:46:52.351	"Cheated? Cheated?"
00:46:52.520	00:46:54.590	"Oh, I am offended."
00:46:54.680	00:46:56.511	"Come on, baby, <br> let's cut some rug."
00:46:59.200	00:47:01.668	"Oh! What the..."
00:47:01.760	00:47:02.760	"Oh."
00:47:02.880	00:47:04.154	"How did that get there?"
00:47:04.840	00:47:06.796	"Run for it, baby! <br> Hey!"
00:47:08.960	00:47:10.029	"Get him!"
00:47:18.920	00:47:19.920	"Excuse me!"
00:47:21.440	00:47:23.271	"Don't let him get away!"
00:47:29.560	00:47:31.551	"- Thanks, Derek! <br> - Out of the way!"
00:47:39.800	00:47:42.519	"So long, suckers!"
00:47:52.680	00:47:53.874	"Good morning, Buster."
00:47:54.040	00:47:55.189	"Hey, Eddie, <br> how are you?"
00:47:55.280	00:47:56.599	"Good. <br> How's the show going?"
00:47:56.680	00:47:58.033	"Ah, it's going great."
00:47:58.120	00:48:00.190	"And, hey, that's a sharp <br> jacket you've got on today."
00:48:00.280	00:48:01.952	"Oh, thanks."
00:48:02.040	00:48:03.040	"Wait."
00:48:04.120	00:48:05.599	"What are you <br> doing here?"
00:48:05.680	00:48:08.877	"Eddie, you can't come visit your nana <br> without bringing her some flowers."
00:48:08.960	00:48:09.960	"Here."
00:48:10.040	00:48:12.508	"- What? No! Buster, no! <br> - Don't go in there!"
00:48:13.080	00:48:14.513	"Yes, can I help... <br> Buster!"
00:48:14.640	00:48:16.631	"Ah, Nana!"
00:48:20.840	00:48:23.434	"Just look at you, dear. Wow!"
00:48:23.520	00:48:25.397	"You don't look <br> a day over 90!"
00:48:25.480	00:48:26.595	"Oh, my gosh!"
00:48:26.760	00:48:28.318	"Buster Moon!"
00:48:28.400	00:48:30.152	"We met at Eddie's graduation."
00:48:30.240	00:48:31.468	"Oh, lucky me."
00:48:31.560	00:48:33.676	"A visit from <br> my useless grandson"
00:48:33.760	00:48:36.228	"and his ghastly <br> little theater friend."
00:48:36.320	00:48:37.958	"Look at that, <br> she remembers me."
00:48:38.040	00:48:39.109	"Okay, Nana,"
00:48:39.280	00:48:43.034	"how would you like to be the sponsor <br> for a very prestigious prize?"
00:48:43.120	00:48:45.998	"Not for that singing contest <br> I saw on the news."
00:48:46.080	00:48:47.149	"That's the one!"
00:48:47.520	00:48:49.397	"Oh, I see."
00:48:49.480	00:48:51.835	"You don't have <br> the money, do you?"
00:48:52.000	00:48:53.760	"Well, we don't quite <br> have it all locked in..."
00:48:53.840	00:48:55.592	"Well, you'll not get <br> a cent out of me."
00:48:55.680	00:48:56.696	"Nana, please <br> just listen to me..."
00:48:56.720	00:48:57.755	"No, absolutely not."
00:48:57.840	00:48:58.909	"Don't listen to him, Nana."
00:48:59.040	00:49:00.598	"I'm not listening <br> to either of you."
00:49:00.680	00:49:03.558	"Lapsang souchong. No sugar. <br> And be quick about it."
00:49:03.640	00:49:04.755	"Uh, Nana..."
00:49:04.840	00:49:06.910	"I don't know <br> how to make tea."
00:49:07.960	00:49:12.112	"Wow. I saw <br> this show when I was a kid."
00:49:12.200	00:49:14.350	"Nana, you were <br> absolutely amazing."
00:49:14.520	00:49:17.080	"Please, this flattery <br> is futile."
00:49:17.160	00:49:20.072	"I have no intention <br> of bailing you out."
00:49:20.160	00:49:21.673	"Your pathetic shows <br> are the reason"
00:49:21.760	00:49:23.716	"that theater no longer <br> has an audience."
00:49:23.800	00:49:26.917	"Oh, but this show is gonna pack them <br> in like it did in the good old days."
00:49:27.080	00:49:30.152	"They were not good old days, <br> Mr. Moon."
00:49:30.360	00:49:33.033	"They were magnificent."
00:49:33.240	00:49:35.117	"And that theater of yours,"
00:49:35.320	00:49:38.949	"it was a palace of wonder <br> and magic."
00:49:39.160	00:49:40.434	"But, Nana, it still is."
00:49:40.600	00:49:42.158	"Yeah, right. Ow!"
00:49:42.240	00:49:45.835	"I can recall the ushers <br> in their velvet suits."
00:49:46.200	00:49:49.351	"Queues a mile long <br> just to get a ticket."
00:49:49.440	00:49:54.116	"The curtain rising over <br> that glorious stage."
00:49:54.280	00:49:57.909	"Music and light bringing <br> dreams to life?"
00:49:58.080	00:49:59.308	"Precisely."
00:49:59.480	00:50:01.675	"Well, it's just like <br> you remember it."
00:50:01.760	00:50:04.638	"In fact, I've made it <br> even more spectacular."
00:50:04.760	00:50:05.909	"No, you haven't. <br> Shh."
00:50:06.000	00:50:09.072	"Come see for yourself. A special <br> performance just for you."
00:50:09.160	00:50:10.229	"What do you say, Nana?"
00:50:10.880	00:50:13.633	"I say, you are a liar, <br> Mr. Moon."
00:50:14.360	00:50:15.475	"Okay, well..."
00:50:15.600	00:50:16.919	"We're done now. <br> Thank you, Nana."
00:50:17.080	00:50:19.355	"But anything's better than <br> spending another evening"
00:50:19.440	00:50:21.271	"playing checkers <br> with this old fart."
00:50:21.360	00:50:22.395	"What?"
00:50:22.480	00:50:24.789	"Great! It's gonna <br> blow you away, Nana."
00:50:24.880	00:50:26.598	"And that is no lie!"
00:50:27.400	00:50:28.515	"Now, listen up!"
00:50:28.760	00:50:31.194	"Tomorrow we're going to have <br> a full preview of the show."
00:50:31.280	00:50:34.636	"And our audience will be none <br> other than Miss Nana Noodleman."
00:50:34.800	00:50:37.155	"Nana Noodleman? <br> She's still alive?"
00:50:37.600	00:50:39.397	"Oh, yes, and believe me,"
00:50:39.480	00:50:41.675	"she's got some pretty high <br> standards, all right."
00:50:41.760	00:50:43.955	"So, today we're gonna have <br> a full dress rehearsal."
00:50:44.040	00:50:46.235	"And I want to see you <br> light up the stage, folks!"
00:50:46.320	00:50:47.320	"Well, that's cool."
00:50:47.440	00:50:48.440	"Meena, Miss Crawly..."
00:50:49.120	00:50:51.839	"- What do you think? <br> - Wow, it's so ambitious."
00:50:51.960	00:50:53.120	"Yeah, are you sure <br> about this?"
00:50:53.160	00:50:55.515	"I promised Nana <br> something spectacular."
00:50:55.600	00:50:56.999	"And this..."
00:50:57.080	00:50:58.798	"It's gonna blow her away. <br> Oh, yes."
00:50:58.880	00:51:00.154	"Two minutes, everybody."
00:51:00.800	00:51:02.000	"Johnny?"
00:51:02.280	00:51:03.793	"Johnny, where are you?"
00:51:05.720	00:51:08.029	"Johnny? Answer <br> the walkie-talkie."
00:51:08.560	00:51:10.296	"Yeah, Dad. I'm here. <br> I'm here. What's wrong?"
00:51:10.320	00:51:12.470	"We got the call. <br> Shipment's coming in."
00:51:12.560	00:51:14.152	"Tonight? <br> Not tonight."
00:51:14.240	00:51:15.559	"Now."
00:51:15.640	00:51:18.154	"Meet us on the corner of <br> Hector Street in two minutes."
00:51:30.280	00:51:32.919	"Stay here. <br> We'll be back in exactly 37..."
00:51:33.000	00:51:35.673	"Yeah, 37 minutes. Yep. <br> You've told me repeatedly."
00:51:42.680	00:51:43.795	"I can make it."
00:51:49.280	00:51:51.840	"Bravo, Mike. <br> Nana is gonna love that!"
00:51:52.440	00:51:54.317	"Aw, you're too kind, Mr. Moon."
00:51:54.400	00:51:56.436	"And I myself <br> am loving the new suit, sir."
00:51:56.520	00:51:58.795	"Okay, can we see Ash next, <br> please?"
00:51:59.600	00:52:01.477	"Ash, let's get you out here!"
00:52:02.400	00:52:05.119	"Oh! Stand back. <br> Moody teenager coming through."
00:52:05.200	00:52:06.235	"Good luck, Ash."
00:52:39.080	00:52:40.080	"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
00:52:40.160	00:52:42.754	"Okay. Enough of that! <br> Cut it! Cut it!"
00:52:44.520	00:52:46.216	"I don't think anyone's gonna <br> call her after that."
00:52:46.240	00:52:47.559	"Okay, Ash. Um..."
00:52:48.360	00:52:49.759	"Hey, come on, Ash."
00:52:51.120	00:52:52.872	"What is it? <br> Do you not like the dress?"
00:52:54.760	00:52:57.228	"Ow! Ow!"
00:52:57.440	00:52:58.634	"Ash, what's wrong?"
00:53:06.280	00:53:10.512	"Well, it sounds to me like you are <br> way better off without that..."
00:53:10.600	00:53:13.558	"That total super-jerk <br> dinkleschplatt!"
00:53:13.640	00:53:16.950	"Exactly. Total super-jerk <br> dinkleschplatt!"
00:53:17.040	00:53:18.678	"Rosita! Gunter! <br> You're on next!"
00:53:18.760	00:53:19.795	"Yeah, okay, here."
00:53:19.880	00:53:21.496	"There should be some gum or <br> some candy in there somewhere."
00:53:21.520	00:53:22.520	"Just help yourself."
00:53:23.320	00:53:24.753	"Rosita! Rosita! <br> Wait! Wait! Wait!"
00:53:25.800	00:53:27.119	"Can I take your place, <br> please?"
00:53:27.200	00:53:28.256	"Sure, Johnny, go ahead."
00:53:28.280	00:53:31.636	"Okay, get ready, 'cause I'm <br> warning you..."
00:53:31.720	00:53:35.269	"This stage is about to explode <br> with major piggy power!"
00:53:36.000	00:53:38.992	"I am so sorry. <br> I have no control."
00:53:39.760	00:53:40.760	"Oh!"
00:53:41.880	00:53:42.915	"Yeah!"
00:53:43.760	00:53:45.876	"Okay, come on, <br> you can do this."
00:53:52.360	00:53:53.395	"Are you okay?"
00:53:54.040	00:53:55.598	"Oh, yes, I'm fine, <br> thank you."
00:53:56.280	00:53:57.474	"How are you?"
00:53:57.600	00:53:59.636	"Okay, Johnny! <br> Let's get you out here!"
00:53:59.720	00:54:02.518	"And you guys, you've got <br> to work on that routine!"
00:54:02.600	00:54:03.999	"Take it away, Johnny!"
00:54:16.040	00:54:19.589	"You can't just sing it, you've <br> got to show the fire and desire!"
00:54:19.680	00:54:22.148	"The fire went out <br> a long time ago."
00:54:22.240	00:54:25.391	"What? Look, I can't even <br> keep count of the steps!"
00:54:25.600	00:54:27.556	"Ugh! Counting schmounting!"
00:54:27.640	00:54:30.279	"She sings too much <br> with her head, right?"
00:54:31.320	00:54:32.355	"Ja, ja, see?"
00:54:32.440	00:54:34.590	"Forget the steps <br> and just like..."
00:54:34.680	00:54:37.194	"Let the music take control <br> of your body parts."
00:54:37.320	00:54:40.995	"My body parts are not responding, okay? <br> It's never gonna happen."
00:54:42.200	00:54:43.599	"I should just <br> be getting groceries."
00:54:43.680	00:54:45.318	"Rosita, no... <br> Rosita, come on!"
00:54:45.400	00:54:46.833	"Please, like, don't go."
00:54:48.520	00:54:51.318	"Psst! <br> Hey! Hey! Down here."
00:54:52.600	00:54:54.716	"Have you seen three <br> nasty-looking bears out there?"
00:54:56.080	00:54:57.957	"Uh, no. <br> Oh, great."
00:54:58.040	00:55:00.270	"Hey, by the way, <br> I love your act. Seriously."
00:55:00.400	00:55:02.120	"The part where you <br> fall flat on your face..."
00:55:02.200	00:55:04.794	"That cracks me up <br> every time."
00:55:04.880	00:55:06.154	"See you around, porky."
00:55:15.720	00:55:16.755	"Aw, man."
00:55:17.040	00:55:19.190	"Johnny, uh, I know <br> I'm asking a lot of you..."
00:55:19.280	00:55:21.191	"Mr. Moon, I'm really trying, <br> I promise."
00:55:21.880	00:55:23.960	"What about your backup song? <br> Have you practiced that?"
00:55:24.040	00:55:25.996	"Uh, well, not yet."
00:55:26.080	00:55:29.072	"Well, why don't we go back <br> and work on that one, okay?"
00:55:29.160	00:55:33.073	"I mean, look, if you play like <br> that in front of Nana Noodleman..."
00:55:35.040	00:55:36.075	"Johnny?"
00:55:44.240	00:55:45.468	"Hey!"
00:56:04.280	00:56:06.669	"We are set <br> for life now, boys!"
00:56:07.040	00:56:09.156	"Oh. Oh. What's going on?"
00:56:09.240	00:56:10.275	"Where's Johnny?"
00:56:10.440	00:56:11.589	"He's not here."
00:56:14.840	00:56:15.989	"Run!"
00:56:28.160	00:56:30.390	"Oh! I'm dead."
00:56:41.960	00:56:43.598	"Okay, wait, let me see..."
00:56:52.000	00:56:53.831	"No, Mom, I have not <br> made any friends."
00:56:53.920	00:56:55.512	"What do you think this is, <br> kindergarten?"
00:56:55.640	00:56:58.016	"If you hadn't squealed to the cops, <br> I wouldn't be in here right now."
00:56:58.040	00:56:59.256	"Honey, when are you <br> getting out?"
00:56:59.280	00:57:01.236	"I'm only gonna be in here <br> for a few years."
00:57:01.320	00:57:02.673	"Well, where'd you <br> hide the money?"
00:57:03.520	00:57:04.520	"Where were you?"
00:57:04.600	00:57:07.478	"Um, well, the thing is, <br> I went to get gas..."
00:57:07.560	00:57:08.595	"Don't lie to me!"
00:57:09.520	00:57:11.431	"Um, I was at a rehearsal."
00:57:11.680	00:57:13.671	"Rehearsal? For what?"
00:57:14.120	00:57:16.759	"I was at a singing contest."
00:57:18.400	00:57:19.515	"Look, Dad..."
00:57:20.120	00:57:22.793	"I'm sorry, I just don't want <br> to be in your gang."
00:57:22.880	00:57:24.199	"I want to be a singer."
00:57:24.240	00:57:27.516	"Singer? Look, Dad, no, it's okay. <br> I can get the bail money."
00:57:27.600	00:57:29.556	"There's a prize. <br> It's $ 100.000."
00:57:33.520	00:57:36.193	"How did I end up <br> with a son like you, eh?"
00:57:36.880	00:57:38.393	"You're nothing like me."
00:57:38.840	00:57:41.070	"You never were <br> and you never will be."
00:57:41.160	00:57:44.357	"I'll get you out! Dad, wait! <br> I'll get the money. I promise!"
00:58:20.920	00:58:24.276	"Johnny! <br> You gave me a fright there."
00:58:24.400	00:58:26.436	"Sorry, I didn't mean to. <br> I just..."
00:58:27.040	00:58:30.476	"Well, I know it's late, but I could <br> really use some extra piano lessons."
00:58:33.120	00:58:34.120	"Ah-ha."
00:58:35.880	00:58:37.677	"Mmm. That's it."
00:58:39.400	00:58:40.515	"That's good."
00:58:41.000	00:58:42.228	"You're getting it."
00:58:51.600	00:58:52.656	"Shoppers are reminded"
00:58:52.680	00:58:55.114	"the store will close <br> in 15 minutes. Thank you."
00:59:57.080	00:59:58.672	"The lady in aisle six..."
01:00:00.680	01:00:02.079	"That was awesome."
01:00:05.480	01:00:06.480	"All right."
01:00:07.720	01:00:10.473	"Mr. Moon, <br> are you sure this is legal?"
01:00:10.560	01:00:12.437	"Uh, I don't know."
01:00:12.520	01:00:14.880	"But if you keep asking questions, <br> we'll never get this done."
01:00:15.760	01:00:16.795	"Now, hit it!"
01:00:17.920	01:00:19.035	"Oh! <br> Ahh!"
01:00:22.560	01:00:23.834	"A little higher."
01:00:26.040	01:00:27.439	"There it is! Thank you!"
01:00:46.440	01:00:47.440	"Hey!"
01:00:47.800	01:00:48.869	"Posters up!"
01:00:49.120	01:00:51.395	"You... <br> Now, run away!"
01:00:51.480	01:00:53.391	"Come back here, you vandals!"
01:01:11.000	01:01:12.911	"Rosita, have you seen my car... <br> Whoa!"
01:01:17.280	01:01:19.589	"Rosita? What the..."
01:01:19.680	01:01:20.795	"What's going on?"
01:01:21.880	01:01:23.074	"Rosita!"
01:01:27.200	01:01:29.430	"Kids, where's Mommy?"
01:01:36.160	01:01:37.160	"Phew!"
01:01:37.760	01:01:39.113	"How's that, Miss Crawly?"
01:01:41.160	01:01:42.160	"Hey! <br> Oh!"
01:01:43.080	01:01:44.080	"Sorry!"
01:01:44.120	01:01:46.953	"Mr. Moon would like everyone to <br> meet backstage before she arrives."
01:01:56.320	01:01:57.320	"Wow."
01:01:57.800	01:01:58.800	"You wrote that?"
01:01:59.200	01:02:01.794	"Uh, yeah. Do you like it?"
01:02:01.880	01:02:04.633	"Are you kidding? <br> It's fantastic!"
01:02:04.760	01:02:06.432	"You've got to <br> sing that today!"
01:02:08.200	01:02:09.349	"Mike, you're on first."
01:02:09.440	01:02:11.351	"Sure. Just a second here."
01:02:11.440	01:02:12.440	"Honey, I'm busy."
01:02:12.520	01:02:13.669	"What? I can't hear you."
01:02:13.800	01:02:16.917	"Rosita and Gunter, <br> you're on after Mike."
01:02:17.000	01:02:18.911	"You got it, boss. <br> Rosita!"
01:02:19.000	01:02:22.151	"Super cool! <br> You've, like, totally come back!"
01:02:22.240	01:02:24.151	"Okay, Johnny, you follow them."
01:02:24.240	01:02:27.198	"What? Oh, yeah. <br> I'm ready. Yeah, yeah."
01:02:27.280	01:02:28.280	"Ash, you're..."
01:02:28.320	01:02:29.548	"After Johnny. I got it."
01:02:29.680	01:02:31.193	"And Meena. Last chance, kid."
01:02:31.320	01:02:33.390	"You wanna join these guys <br> out there today?"
01:02:33.600	01:02:36.512	"I would... <br> I just get so scared."
01:02:36.680	01:02:37.680	"Sure, you do."
01:02:37.760	01:02:39.955	"But you know <br> how to get over that, right?"
01:02:40.040	01:02:41.473	"Uh, no."
01:02:41.720	01:02:43.756	"You just start singing!"
01:02:43.840	01:02:45.360	"Do what you love, <br> then you'll be great,"
01:02:45.480	01:02:46.576	"'cause you won't <br> be afraid anymore,"
01:02:46.600	01:02:47.976	"because you'll actually <br> be doing it."
01:02:48.000	01:02:49.069	"Right?"
01:02:49.200	01:02:50.599	"Uh..."
01:02:50.680	01:02:53.114	"Look, do you love to sing?"
01:02:53.200	01:02:54.758	"I mean, do you <br> really love it?"
01:02:55.320	01:02:56.389	"Of course I do."
01:02:56.480	01:02:57.959	"Then you face this <br> head on, Meena."
01:02:58.680	01:02:59.696	"Look, it's like <br> my dad always said,"
01:02:59.720	01:03:02.632	"'Don't let fear stop you from <br> doing the thing you love.'"
01:03:03.520	01:03:05.590	"Uh... <br> Okay, I'll do it."
01:03:05.680	01:03:07.318	"Great! <br> Mr. Moon!"
01:03:07.920	01:03:08.955	"She's here!"
01:03:23.480	01:03:24.480	"Nana!"
01:03:25.600	01:03:28.194	"Oh! Do not even think <br> of embracing me."
01:03:28.280	01:03:31.352	"You got it. Eddie, please show <br> your nana to the royal box."
01:03:31.440	01:03:34.716	"Oh, for heaven sakes! <br> I'm perfectly capable of walking."
01:03:35.720	01:03:37.597	"You nervous? <br> Are you kidding?"
01:03:37.680	01:03:40.148	"I'm absolutely terrified."
01:03:46.880	01:03:49.997	"Boss, that's his car, <br> isn't it? Right there!"
01:03:51.640	01:03:52.755	"Pull over."
01:03:57.640	01:04:01.235	"Lapsang souchong, <br> courtesy of Mr. Moon..."
01:04:02.720	01:04:04.870	"Oh... <br> Wonderful."
01:04:08.600	01:04:10.456	"Honey, <br> the show is starting, all right?"
01:04:10.480	01:04:12.436	"I can't talk now. I gotta go."
01:04:12.520	01:04:13.555	"Of course I love you."
01:04:13.640	01:04:15.720	"You think I'd buy you diamond <br> earrings if I didn't..."
01:04:15.840	01:04:17.910	"Where is my money?"
01:04:18.400	01:04:19.456	"Okay, okay, listen, listen."
01:04:19.480	01:04:22.836	"I just, maybe, kind of, <br> spent it all."
01:04:23.280	01:04:24.280	"You know?"
01:04:24.760	01:04:26.816	"No, no, please, please, wait! <br> I'll give you the money!"
01:04:26.840	01:04:28.831	"I'll get you $100.000!"
01:04:30.040	01:04:32.998	"Where are you going <br> to get that kind of money?"
01:04:33.080	01:04:34.115	"Moon! Okay?"
01:04:35.000	01:04:36.035	"Moon's got my money."
01:04:37.680	01:04:39.750	"Who is this 'Moon'?"
01:04:43.160	01:04:48.188	"All creatures great and small, <br> welcome to the Moon Theater!"
01:04:49.280	01:04:51.919	"I am your host, <br> Buster Moon, and..."
01:04:52.240	01:04:53.514	"Whoa!"
01:04:55.920	01:04:58.388	"Okay. Behold!"
01:04:58.480	01:05:03.156	"The very first stage <br> lit entirely by squid power!"
01:05:11.360	01:05:12.360	"Yeah!"
01:05:12.880	01:05:15.474	"Beautiful work, guys. Now, <br> just follow me on the beat."
01:05:18.040	01:05:20.998	"And as you can see, <br> this is no ordinary theater."
01:05:21.080	01:05:24.436	"This is a palace <br> of wonder and magic."
01:05:26.000	01:05:27.991	"He's done it! <br> He's really done it, Nana!"
01:05:28.720	01:05:30.676	"Oh! Goodness!"
01:05:30.760	01:05:33.149	"Now, welcome <br> our first contestant."
01:05:34.360	01:05:36.032	"Whoa!"
01:05:37.120	01:05:38.599	"Which one of you is Moon?"
01:05:38.800	01:05:40.756	"Hey, hey, you can't <br> just barge in here!"
01:05:40.840	01:05:42.398	"You know this guy?"
01:05:42.840	01:05:44.353	"Mike? <br> Right."
01:05:44.440	01:05:47.910	"Mike here says you got his money, <br> and it's in that box."
01:05:49.200	01:05:51.236	"No, no, just hold on <br> a moment here."
01:05:51.320	01:05:55.313	"That's prize money, and it's not <br> Mike's unless he wins it fair and..."
01:05:55.440	01:05:58.637	"Give him the money! Okay! Okay! <br> Hey, hey, take it! The whole chest!"
01:05:58.760	01:06:00.591	"It's yours, okay? <br> All right here."
01:06:00.680	01:06:01.999	"Open it. <br> Open it?"
01:06:02.520	01:06:03.520	"Me?"
01:06:04.160	01:06:05.229	"Open it!"
01:06:05.320	01:06:06.753	"Okay, no..."
01:06:06.840	01:06:08.398	"I just don't have the keys."
01:06:08.480	01:06:09.833	"So, maybe you can <br> come back later?"
01:06:10.040	01:06:11.632	"Get outta the way!"
01:06:12.120	01:06:14.236	"No, no, no! Wait!"
01:06:20.400	01:06:21.913	"Hey, there you go!"
01:06:22.040	01:06:24.156	"Big guy with a bat! <br> Who needs keys, right?"
01:06:24.240	01:06:26.320	"All right. Well, let's get <br> this thing squared up now."
01:06:27.640	01:06:28.709	"What the..."
01:06:29.160	01:06:30.160	"That's it?"
01:06:31.080	01:06:32.513	"That's all there is?"
01:06:33.960	01:06:34.995	"He lied."
01:06:37.280	01:06:38.679	"Moon lied to us all!"
01:06:38.760	01:06:40.318	"Wait a second. <br> I can explain..."
01:06:40.400	01:06:42.176	"He's your problem, not me. <br> This is just a prop."
01:06:42.200	01:06:43.713	"So where's the $100.000?"
01:06:44.240	01:06:45.240	"You're kidding!"
01:06:45.360	01:06:47.016	"I cannot believe you <br> lied to us this whole time."
01:06:47.040	01:06:48.314	"Huge waste <br> of everyone's..."
01:06:48.440	01:06:49.440	"This was just..."
01:06:57.680	01:06:58.680	"Buster! Look out!"
01:07:09.600	01:07:10.919	"I'm stuck!"
01:07:37.320	01:07:38.878	"Buster! <br> It's falling! Let go!"
01:07:49.800	01:07:52.155	"Whoa! Whoa!"
01:07:58.440	01:08:00.829	"Okay, okay. <br> Steady, girl. Steady."
01:08:18.120	01:08:20.918	"No, no, no!"
01:08:24.280	01:08:25.280	"Oh!"
01:08:25.720	01:08:27.870	"Ah! Is everyone okay?"
01:08:28.160	01:08:29.195	"Nana!"
01:08:30.400	01:08:32.675	"I'm so sorry! I just..."
01:08:33.200	01:08:35.031	"No, no, don't go!"
01:08:35.120	01:08:38.396	"Has anyone seen my glass eye?"
01:08:38.800	01:08:39.800	"Oh..."
01:08:39.880	01:08:41.520	"It's right here, Miss Crawly. <br> I've got it."
01:08:47.880	01:08:48.915	"Look out!"
01:09:12.960	01:09:13.995	"No."
01:09:30.800	01:09:31.949	"Oh, Dad."
01:09:32.080	01:09:33.513	"I'm so sorry."
01:09:44.760	01:09:46.034	"Where is Mike?"
01:09:46.520	01:09:48.556	"He must be dead."
01:09:48.640	01:09:50.119	"Come on, let's go!"
01:09:58.400	01:10:00.072	"Mommy, where are you?"
01:10:00.960	01:10:02.837	"Help! <br> Oh, my gosh!"
01:10:03.120	01:10:04.120	"Help!"
01:10:04.200	01:10:05.997	"Hold on! Mommy's here!"
01:10:13.120	01:10:15.336	"I'm <br> standing at the scene right now, Judy."
01:10:15.360	01:10:16.759	"And I can tell you,"
01:10:16.840	01:10:19.957	"it is a miracle anyone survived <br> this unbelievable disaster."
01:10:56.200	01:10:59.476	"Yeah, Buster Moon certainly brought <br> down the house once and for all today."
01:10:59.560	01:11:02.791	"And although Mr. Moon has not <br> been available for questions,"
01:11:02.880	01:11:04.199	"unconfirmed reports suggest"
01:11:04.360	01:11:06.590	"he was responsible <br> for building a water tank"
01:11:06.680	01:11:08.910	"that exploded <br> and flooded the building."
01:11:09.000	01:11:10.911	"I've been told <br> the 250 squid"
01:11:11.000	01:11:13.616	"who had been part of Moon's display <br> are in fact..."
01:11:13.640	01:11:16.234	"Eddie? There's someone <br> at the door."
01:11:16.360	01:11:19.320	"And that none of <br> them were harmed during the incident."
01:11:19.360	01:11:22.193	"Whether they will be returning to <br> their usual work is not yet..."
01:11:23.920	01:11:25.035	"Oh, no."
01:11:25.680	01:11:26.954	"Mr. Moon?"
01:11:29.080	01:11:31.880	"Come on, Moon. You can't just <br> hide out in your buddy's pool house."
01:11:31.960	01:11:34.793	"Yeah, we just wanna make <br> sure you're all right, that's all."
01:11:38.040	01:11:40.110	"Hey, Mr. Moon. <br> You okay?"
01:11:40.200	01:11:44.034	"Guys, look. I'm sorry <br> about what happened..."
01:11:44.120	01:11:45.473	"And the prize money and..."
01:11:45.560	01:11:47.039	"Oh, it's okay."
01:11:47.120	01:11:49.475	"No. None of this is okay."
01:11:49.720	01:11:51.073	"At least we're all <br> in one piece."
01:11:51.200	01:11:52.349	"Yeah, and you know what?"
01:11:52.440	01:11:54.954	"I bet we can find some other <br> place to put the show on."
01:11:55.080	01:11:56.479	"- Right? <br> - Yeah!"
01:11:56.560	01:12:00.314	"The show? <br> Guys, I'm done."
01:12:02.200	01:12:04.236	"Are you serious? <br> What do you mean, 'done'? Come on!"
01:12:04.560	01:12:06.551	"Didn't you see this? <br> Huh?"
01:12:06.880	01:12:09.553	"Look, it says <br> I'm a 'danger to society.'"
01:12:10.840	01:12:13.877	"'A deluded, <br> washed-up charlatan"
01:12:13.960	01:12:16.110	"'who never had <br> a hit in his career.'"
01:12:16.240	01:12:18.071	"Oh, come on, <br> you don't believe all that?"
01:12:18.400	01:12:20.311	"Yeah. I do."
01:12:20.600	01:12:23.056	"Listen. You're not the <br> only one who lost something here."
01:12:23.080	01:12:24.354	"- We all did. <br> - Ja!"
01:12:24.440	01:12:28.149	"I mean, I lost any chance of ever <br> speaking to my dad again over this show."
01:12:28.280	01:12:30.874	"- Sorry. <br> - Oh, Mr. Moon, don't..."
01:12:31.640	01:12:32.880	"Forget about it."
01:12:32.920	01:12:34.911	"What is this? <br> I don't understand."
01:12:35.000	01:12:36.433	"Come on, <br> let's get out of here."
01:12:40.280	01:12:41.599	"Mr. Moon?"
01:12:42.040	01:12:43.553	"Meena, please..."
01:12:44.600	01:12:46.830	"I baked a cake for you <br> 'cause..."
01:12:46.920	01:12:51.789	"Well, I know you're sad right now and <br> probably afraid to try again and..."
01:12:51.880	01:12:53.074	"Yeah, I am afraid."
01:12:53.480	01:12:55.118	"I'm afraid that this..."
01:12:55.200	01:12:56.997	"This, me, right now, <br> this is who I am."
01:12:57.080	01:12:58.559	"This is my lot for life."
01:12:58.640	01:13:01.074	"That I'm not the guy <br> that my dad wanted me to be."
01:13:01.160	01:13:02.275	"Not by a million miles."
01:13:02.360	01:13:03.360	"But you told me..."
01:13:03.480	01:13:05.198	"What? What did I say?"
01:13:05.280	01:13:06.349	"Well, you know..."
01:13:06.440	01:13:08.715	"'Don't let fear stop you from <br> doing the thing you love.'"
01:13:08.800	01:13:11.917	"Ugh! That's just a bunch <br> of stupid, corny..."
01:13:12.040	01:13:15.749	"No, it's not. What? You really believe <br> that you're gonna be a singer?"
01:13:15.840	01:13:16.840	"Well, yeah, maybe..."
01:13:16.960	01:13:19.155	"Well, then you're just <br> as big a fool as I am!"
01:13:21.200	01:13:22.235	"Look, kid..."
01:13:22.360	01:13:24.396	"You and me, we're both"
01:13:24.480	01:13:25.913	"afraid for good reason."
01:13:26.600	01:13:27.953	"'Cause deep down, we know..."
01:13:29.600	01:13:31.477	"We just don't have <br> what it takes."
01:14:07.200	01:14:09.316	"I'm awake, I'm awake!"
01:14:11.560	01:14:12.595	"Hey, Buster."
01:14:12.680	01:14:14.079	"Hey, Eddie."
01:14:14.160	01:14:15.798	"Man, where'd you go? <br> Are you okay?"
01:14:15.880	01:14:19.156	"Listen, could you meet me at the <br> corner of Dinsdale and Lemington?"
01:14:19.240	01:14:20.559	"Now?"
01:14:20.640	01:14:22.039	"Yeah, please."
01:14:22.560	01:14:23.993	"And could you..."
01:14:24.080	01:14:26.469	"Ahem. Could you bring me <br> a spare Speedo?"
01:14:27.640	01:14:28.868	"Speedo?"
01:14:35.480	01:14:36.629	"Hey, Miss Crawly."
01:14:36.800	01:14:38.552	"Oh! Hello, Eddie!"
01:14:38.640	01:14:40.232	"Hey, did you <br> bring the Speedo?"
01:14:40.400	01:14:42.709	"The... <br> Oh, yeah. Uh, here."
01:14:43.560	01:14:45.400	"Great. You're a real pal, Eddie."
01:14:46.760	01:14:48.796	"Oh! Our first customer!"
01:14:48.920	01:14:50.336	"Miss Crawly, fill the bucket."
01:14:50.360	01:14:51.395	"Be right with you, sir."
01:14:53.200	01:14:54.394	"Wait, what are you doing?"
01:14:54.560	01:14:56.312	"The only other job I know."
01:14:59.000	01:15:01.958	"I'm just glad <br> my dad isn't here to see this."
01:15:03.560	01:15:04.913	"Miss Crawly, if you would... <br> Oh!"
01:15:06.160	01:15:07.160	"Thanks."
01:15:07.240	01:15:09.435	"Well, gotta go to work."
01:15:09.680	01:15:11.159	"Uh, I'll see you around, <br> Eddie."
01:15:29.520	01:15:31.590	"Come on! <br> I ain't got all day!"
01:15:31.960	01:15:34.269	"Aw, forget it."
01:15:34.440	01:15:35.919	"Too slow, dude."
01:15:36.120	01:15:37.120	"Whoa!"
01:15:42.640	01:15:43.959	"One moment, <br> please, sir!"
01:15:44.760	01:15:47.638	"Well, you know the good thing <br> about hitting rock bottom?"
01:15:48.280	01:15:51.511	"There's only one way <br> left to go. And that's up."
01:15:52.280	01:15:54.714	"Come on. <br> You wash. I'll dry."
01:15:58.920	01:16:00.751	"Thank you, Miss Crawly."
01:16:41.120	01:16:42.519	"Buster, where you going?"
01:17:26.800	01:17:28.358	"I, uh..."
01:17:29.320	01:17:32.073	"Do you think you could sing like <br> that in front of a real audience?"
01:17:32.880	01:17:36.270	"I don't know. <br> But I wanna try."
01:17:36.680	01:17:38.113	"Good."
01:17:38.200	01:17:39.315	"'Cause I wanna see it."
01:17:41.200	01:17:43.555	"We are? Seriously?"
01:17:43.720	01:17:46.188	"Oh, my gosh! Okay, yes. <br> I'll be right over."
01:17:49.040	01:17:50.393	"Hello?"
01:17:50.560	01:17:51.834	"Oh, hello, Mr. Moon."
01:17:53.560	01:17:56.736	"Some say he's <br> the worst showman this city's ever seen."
01:17:56.760	01:17:58.352	"Some say he's <br> a walking disaster."
01:17:58.480	01:18:00.550	"A loose cannon."
01:18:00.640	01:18:01.789	"Well, tomorrow night,"
01:18:01.920	01:18:06.038	"the name Buster Moon will go down in <br> entertainment history once and for all,"
01:18:06.160	01:18:09.755	"as he and this bunch of bumbling <br> amateurs attempt to re-stage the show"
01:18:10.360	01:18:12.351	"that brought down his theater."
01:18:57.000	01:18:59.195	"Ah, don't you worry, Mike, <br> all is forgiven."
01:18:59.280	01:19:00.616	"Just glad you're back <br> in one piece."
01:19:00.640	01:19:01.976	"Oh, yeah, you're <br> too kind, Mr. Moon."
01:19:02.000	01:19:04.036	"And, uh, <br> the prize money?"
01:19:04.120	01:19:06.236	"I mean, it's real <br> this time, right?"
01:19:06.320	01:19:08.550	"There is no prize money <br> 'cause there's no competition."
01:19:08.680	01:19:10.136	"Tonight, you're singing <br> for yourselves."
01:19:10.160	01:19:11.832	"Two minutes, everybody! <br> Final checks."
01:19:11.920	01:19:13.114	"Singing for ourselves?"
01:19:13.640	01:19:15.392	"Unbelievable."
01:19:15.520	01:19:17.750	"Who's he... This is crazy. <br> I'm outta here."
01:19:18.320	01:19:19.833	"Hello!"
01:19:19.920	01:19:22.559	"We're putting on a show here."
01:19:22.640	01:19:24.756	"You all should <br> come and see it!"
01:19:24.840	01:19:26.353	"You! Come on!"
01:19:26.520	01:19:28.954	"Come on, fella! <br> It's gonna be really good!"
01:19:30.680	01:19:32.352	"Hey! How's our new <br> stagehand getting on?"
01:19:32.440	01:19:33.475	"He's learning fast."
01:19:33.560	01:19:35.835	"All set and standing by! <br> I love this headset!"
01:19:35.920	01:19:37.956	"The audience are <br> in their seats, Mr. Moon."
01:19:38.040	01:19:39.040	"Great!"
01:19:39.640	01:19:40.959	"Hmm."
01:19:41.200	01:19:42.235	"Caspar!"
01:19:42.320	01:19:44.440	"That's all? <br> Get your pants back on, young man!"
01:19:44.800	01:19:47.837	"Please, you guys, please. <br> Please sit down!"
01:19:48.000	01:19:49.956	"Hey! Put your shoes <br> back on right now!"
01:19:50.040	01:19:52.349	"Zoe, I saw that! Stop it!"
01:19:52.640	01:19:55.473	"And, Leo, that is disgusting."
01:19:55.720	01:19:58.518	"Well, John, I've covered many <br> disasters for this network,"
01:19:58.600	01:19:59.828	"but this is sure to..."
01:19:59.920	01:20:01.720	"Oh, they're about to start."
01:20:01.840	01:20:03.558	"Okay, guys, listen up!"
01:20:03.640	01:20:05.437	"Look, I gotta tell you, um,"
01:20:05.520	01:20:08.557	"there's not much of <br> an audience out there tonight."
01:20:08.640	01:20:10.119	"But you know what?"
01:20:10.240	01:20:11.559	"It doesn't matter."
01:20:11.720	01:20:13.631	"It really doesn't."
01:20:13.800	01:20:16.394	"'Cause tonight is our night."
01:20:16.560	01:20:18.232	"And whatever happens,"
01:20:19.240	01:20:22.550	"I just want you all to know how proud <br> I am to be a part of this with you."
01:20:23.200	01:20:24.553	"Good luck, Mr. Moon."
01:20:24.840	01:20:25.920	"Good luck, everyone... <br> Whoa!"
01:20:30.720	01:20:31.994	"Whoop! Uh..."
01:20:32.080	01:20:33.832	"Sorry. Just jumped <br> the cue there."
01:20:33.920	01:20:36.070	"Don't worry. I'm gonna <br> get the hang of this."
01:20:41.920	01:20:43.069	"Here we go."
01:20:48.800	01:20:51.553	"All creatures <br> great and small..."
01:20:51.640	01:20:53.437	"...welcome to the..."
01:20:55.360	01:20:56.588	"Oh, hello, there."
01:20:56.840	01:20:58.592	"Great!"
01:20:58.760	01:21:01.558	"Welcome to our newly <br> refurbished, open-air theater."
01:21:02.240	01:21:03.275	"You ready, big guy?"
01:21:03.400	01:21:04.469	"Yeah."
01:21:04.560	01:21:06.039	"I'm, like, totally ready."
01:21:06.120	01:21:07.269	"All right!"
01:21:08.200	01:21:09.428	"Let's do this."
01:21:09.760	01:21:11.716	"Gunter and Rosita!"
01:21:38.800	01:21:40.518	"Are you getting this?"
01:22:00.800	01:22:02.313	"Whoa!"
01:22:36.600	01:22:37.794	"Aren't they great?"
01:22:37.880	01:22:40.520	"What, are you kidding me? <br> It's like watching Jell-O dancing around."
01:22:40.640	01:22:43.200	"Like you could do <br> any better, pip-squeak."
01:22:44.720	01:22:46.073	"All right, all right. Hey!"
01:22:46.160	01:22:49.550	"You wanna see something great? <br> I'll show you great."
01:23:21.200	01:23:23.350	"Gunter and Rosita!"
01:23:24.760	01:23:26.398	"Kids! No! <br> Back to your seats!"
01:23:26.520	01:23:28.670	"Okay, okay. Whoa!"
01:23:28.920	01:23:30.638	"Norman!"
01:23:37.880	01:23:38.995	"All right!"
01:23:39.080	01:23:41.036	"Piggy power! Ha-ha!"
01:23:45.600	01:23:46.715	"That was great!"
01:23:48.200	01:23:51.272	"Well, it seems I'm not the only <br> one who actually enjoyed that."
01:23:51.360	01:23:53.920	"Crowds are beginning to <br> arrive at the scene."
01:23:54.640	01:23:55.675	"Help!"
01:23:55.800	01:23:57.358	"I'm so sorry, Mr. Moon."
01:23:57.440	01:23:58.953	"Johnny, you're on next."
01:24:42.760	01:24:44.159	"What is that?"
01:24:44.240	01:24:46.117	"Turn it down, will ya?"
01:24:47.160	01:24:48.160	"Oi..."
01:24:48.360	01:24:51.033	"Didn't you hear me? <br> I said, turn it..."
01:24:52.240	01:24:53.309	"Johnny?"
01:25:00.120	01:25:01.348	"Johnny."
01:25:03.480	01:25:04.993	"It's Johnny!"
01:25:05.160	01:25:06.513	"That's my son!"
01:25:11.360	01:25:12.360	"My son..."

01:26:23.920	01:26:25.592	"Give it up for Johnny, folks!"
01:26:38.560	01:26:40.835	"What's with the face? <br> You were great!"
01:26:40.920	01:26:41.955	"They loved you!"
01:26:43.840	01:26:45.592	"Yeah, thanks, Rosita."
01:26:56.720	01:26:59.598	"All right. <br> Welcome to all you newcomers!"
01:26:59.680	01:27:02.148	"You are just in time <br> to meet a teenager"
01:27:02.240	01:27:04.515	"who was recently dumped <br> by her boyfriend."
01:27:04.760	01:27:07.069	"I know, right?"
01:27:07.280	01:27:11.114	"But she's gonna chase those blues <br> away with a song of her very own."
01:27:11.200	01:27:14.237	"Allow me to introduce <br> the singing sensation..."
01:27:14.320	01:27:15.320	"Ash!"
01:27:31.960	01:27:32.960	"Judith?"
01:27:33.760	01:27:35.830	"You are all trespassing <br> on private property."
01:27:35.960	01:27:37.296	"What? And you will <br> leave right now."
01:27:37.320	01:27:38.833	"No, no, no. Judith..."
01:27:38.960	01:27:39.960	"All of you!"
01:28:17.840	01:28:19.717	"I am calling the police."
01:28:46.040	01:28:50.079	"Ugh. Seriously? <br> She's not even that good."
01:28:50.160	01:28:52.799	"Yeah, yeah. Totally."
01:29:49.800	01:29:51.392	"Uh..."
01:29:51.480	01:29:53.232	"You guys okay?"
01:29:58.400	01:30:00.152	"Ash! Ash! Ash!"
01:30:01.400	01:30:04.392	"What about that?"
01:30:04.480	01:30:08.393	"We just witnessed the birth <br> of a genuine rock star!"
01:30:08.480	01:30:10.914	"Moon, you've got <br> some stuck here."
01:30:11.000	01:30:12.000	"Ow!"
01:30:23.160	01:30:24.673	"He may be tiny,"
01:30:24.760	01:30:27.115	"but there's no denying <br> his enormous talent."
01:30:27.520	01:30:30.671	"Would you please <br> welcome to the stage, Mike!"
01:30:30.960	01:30:32.439	"What are you <br> doing back here?"
01:30:32.680	01:30:33.680	"Relax, sweetheart."
01:30:33.760	01:30:36.479	"Just came back to show you <br> bozos how it's really done."
01:30:36.560	01:30:38.118	"Now, watch this."
01:31:09.600	01:31:10.999	"Boss! That is him!"
01:31:11.200	01:31:12.428	"That is Mike!"
01:31:53.080	01:31:54.911	"I'm so proud of you."
01:32:05.920	01:32:06.920	"Uh-oh."
01:32:16.040	01:32:17.268	"You gotta be <br> kidding me."
01:32:47.560	01:32:50.632	"Negative. I've lost sight of the <br> suspect and am terminating pursuit."
01:33:09.080	01:33:11.355	"That pip-squeak <br> really was great."
01:33:12.640	01:33:14.517	"Thank you. <br> Thank you so much."
01:33:14.760	01:33:16.637	"Oh, please, <br> you're too kind, really."
01:33:16.720	01:33:18.119	"Look at me, I'm turning red."
01:33:18.200	01:33:19.918	"Stop! I can't take it."
01:33:20.000	01:33:21.069	"Keep it coming."
01:33:21.720	01:33:23.073	"Well, I better get back."
01:33:23.200	01:33:25.350	"They'll be wondering <br> what happened to me."
01:33:25.840	01:33:27.239	"You'll visit me though, yeah?"
01:33:27.640	01:33:28.834	"Yeah, course I will."
01:33:30.840	01:33:32.034	"See you, son."
01:33:42.760	01:33:46.196	"We have one <br> final act for you tonight."
01:33:46.280	01:33:48.430	"Would you please welcome <br> to the stage"
01:33:48.600	01:33:50.795	"for her first ever <br> live appearance,"
01:33:50.880	01:33:51.915	"Meena!"
01:33:55.200	01:33:56.394	"Meena?"
01:33:57.400	01:33:58.719	"Is she coming out?"
01:33:59.920	01:34:01.592	"Meena, what's wrong? <br> Are you okay?"
01:34:01.960	01:34:03.837	"I... I can't move."
01:34:03.920	01:34:06.718	"I'm... I'm terrified."
01:34:09.320	01:34:10.673	"Give me your hand, kid."
01:34:12.880	01:34:13.949	"Okay, deep breaths."
01:34:14.320	01:34:17.073	"Deep breaths, <br> and remember what I told you."
01:34:17.160	01:34:22.188	"You will not feel afraid anymore <br> if you just start singing."
01:34:22.400	01:34:23.469	"Meena!"
01:34:23.560	01:34:24.560	"Meena!"
01:34:27.400	01:34:29.152	"Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry!"
01:34:31.800	01:34:33.074	"Uh..."
01:34:33.400	01:34:34.469	"Okay."
01:34:35.560	01:34:37.152	"Uh..."
01:34:41.120	01:34:42.439	"Sing."
01:34:43.720	01:34:44.869	"Okay."
01:36:16.120	01:36:17.120	"Whoo-hoo!"
01:36:22.520	01:36:24.715	"Guys, guys, wait. <br> We can talk this over, right?"
01:36:24.840	01:36:27.070	"We're all reasonable <br> individuals here."
01:36:31.760	01:36:32.909	"Get in! Quick!"
01:36:33.440	01:36:34.668	"Oh, thank you, sweetheart!"
01:36:36.120	01:36:37.872	"Whew! That was close! <br> Yeah."
01:37:38.280	01:37:39.315	"Come on!"
01:38:21.240	01:38:22.639	"She did it!"
01:38:23.120	01:38:24.348	"Go, go!"
01:38:33.640	01:38:36.712	"Oh, Dad, I wish <br> you could see this."
