<style>
  .main-container {

``` 

## addAwesomeMarkers icons

### 01: basic use

Run `~/projects/study/r/shiny/ex/study_shiny/ex01/01.R`

### 02: icon from a gallery

Use an icon from the page https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&c=vehicles&m=free

Run `~/projects/study/r/shiny/ex/study_shiny/ex01/02.R`

``` r
icon.fa <- makeAwesomeIcon(icon = "bicycle", markerColor = "red", library = "vehicles",
                           iconColor = "black")
``` 

This doesn't work. 

We can only use the following library values: glphicon, fa (fontawesome), ion (ionicons)

### 03: text inside marker

Use text inside marker:

Run `~/projects/study/r/shiny/ex/study_shiny/ex01/03.R`

``` r
icon.fa <- makeAwesomeIcon(text = "1")
``` 

### 04: use numeric values

Run `~/projects/study/r/shiny/ex/study_shiny/ex01/04.R`

``` r
icon.fa <- makeAwesomeIcon(text = 1)
``` 

### 05: make icons smaller

Run `~/projects/study/r/shiny/ex/study_shiny/ex01/05.R`

It doesn't work.

## removeMarker

### 06: basic use

Run `~/projects/study/r/shiny/ex/study_shiny/ex01/06.R`

### 07: use with awesome markers

Run `~/projects/study/r/shiny/ex/study_shiny/ex01/07.R`
