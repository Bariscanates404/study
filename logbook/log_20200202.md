# Reading Notes: Clojure

## Vars: https://clojure.org/reference/vars

The special form def creates (and interns) a Var. If the Var did not already exist and no initial value is supplied, the var is unbound

``` bash
user=> (def x)
#'user/x
user=> x
#object[clojure.lang.Var$Unbound 0x14008db3 "Unbound: #'user/x"]
``` 

Supplying an initial value binds the root (even if it was already bound).

``` bash
user=> (def x 1)
#'user/x

user=> x
1
``` 

## interning: https://clojure.org/reference/vars#interning

This find-or-create process is called interning

## var: https://clojure.org/reference/special_forms#var

`(var symbol)`

The symbol must resolve to a var, and the Var object itself (not its value) is returned. The reader macro `#'x` expands to `(var x)`.

## The Reader: https://clojure.org/reference/reader

Clojure is a homoiconic language, which is a fancy term describing the fact that Clojure programs are represented by Clojure data structures

Clojure is defined in terms of the evaluation of data structures and not in terms of the syntax of character streams/files

it is the task of the reader to parse the text and produce the data structure the compiler will see

This is not compilation. 

The reader is represented by the function read, which reads the next form (not character) from a stream, and returns the object represented by that form


## Bindings: https://kimh.github.io/clojure-by-example/#bindings

Giving names to values is called assignment in many programming languages. However, we call the mapping between names and values binding in Clojure.

## Symbol: https://kimh.github.io/clojure-by-example/#symbol

Symbols are used to bind names to values. a b my-cool-function nyncat: they are all symbols in Clojure.

``` bash
user> (type 'a)
clojure.lang.Symbol

``` 

## Scope: https://kimh.github.io/clojure-by-example/#scope

This kind of scope is called lexical scope. For those whom English is not your first language, lexical means words in a sentence. The scope is lexical because the compiler relies on the physical location of the symbol (word) in a program (sentence) to resolve them

``` bash
user> (let [a "aaa"]
        (let [a "AAA"]
          (println a))
        (println a))
AAA
aaa
nil
``` 

## defn:

You can expand the metadata with meta. Notice that say-hello is first passed to var. This is because meta expects it's argument to be var object, not value, and var will turn the passed symbol into var object.

``` bash
user=> (meta (var say-hello))
{:added "1.0", :ns #<Namespace user>, :name say-hello, :file "NO_SOURCE_PATH", :static true, :column 1, :line 1, :arglists ([name]), :doc "Takes name argument and say hello to the name"}
``` 

``` bash
user> (meta #'say-hello)
{:added "1.0", :ns #<Namespace user>, :name say-hello, :file "NO_SOURCE_PATH", :static true, :column 1, :line 1, :arglists ([name]), :doc "Takes name argument and say hello to the name"}
``` 

`#'` is the reader macro for var and works the exactly same.

## Namespaces

A namespace is constructed of symbols chained by .. clojure.core, clojure-http.client, my.app.example: they are all namespaces.

### Require

One of the important roles of namespace is providing a scope for Clojure objects
