# Spacemacs Major Modes

## [Documentation confusion for Vim users (what is a major mode?) · Issue #438 · syl20bnr/spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/438)

Major mode: simply a command in emacs. 

It defines behaviors of a buffer. ex:

- syntax highlighting
- indentation
- set of commands specialized

`vim mode` = `evil state`

`spacemacs-mode` major mode for `*spacemacs*` buffer. it is a read-only loading screen. nowhere else used.

spacemacs configuration files are elisp files. the major mode for them is `emacs-lisp-mode`

there can be only one major mode active per buffer.

## [Major Modes - GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Major-Modes.html)

Each buffer has one major mode at a time.

Every major mode has a major mode command. The name ends in `-mode`

There is no way to turn off a major mode.

`fundamental-mode` has no mode-specific definitions

`fundamental-mode` command does not run any mode hooks.

`define-derived-mode` macro is used to set up a new mode

It sets up the new mode as  a variant of an existing major mode: `derived modes`

`Basic Major Modes`: common modes to derive from

opt01: comment olarak eval etmeyi dene

## emacs ile comment olarak eval et

### keybinding tanımla

ref: `Binding keys - Spacemacs <url:file:///~/projects/study/emacs/study_spacemacs.md#r=g_10998>`

Ref: `~/.spacemacs` > `dotspacemacs/user-config`

`define-key`

[Spacemacs documentation](https://develop.spacemacs.org/doc/DOCUMENTATION.html#binding-keys)

``` elisp
(define-key evil-insert-state-map (kbd "C-]") 'forward-char)
``` 

ref: `Binding keys - Spacemacs <url:file:///~/projects/study/emacs/study_spacemacs.md#r=g_10998>`

Muhtemelen şöyle bir şey olmalı:

``` elisp
(spacemacs/set-leader-keys "C-]" 'forward-char)
``` 

opt02: major mode

[(1) When I want to create a keybinding for a major mode (SPC m etc) is it normal that I then have to make one for (leader etc) as well or am I doing something wrong? : spacemacs](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacemacs/comments/4s5qkb/when_i_want_to_create_a_keybinding_for_a_major/)

``` elisp
(spacemacs/set-leader-keys-for-major-mode 'org-mode "oc" 'org-columns)
``` 

``` 
(spacemacs/set-leader-keys-for-major-mode 'clojure-mode "e;" 'cider-pprint-eval-last-sexp-to-comment)
```
