Architects that haven't beed programming for 20 years. 

So called architect astronauts.

IEEE defn:

> fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution

Ralph Johnson reacts to it:

Problem with IEEE defn:

- relies on notion what are highest level most critical components?

What does it mean? How do you select which components? What makes some of them architectural some of them not.

People who are most familiar with code base. They have:

- shared understanding. 

This is architecture. It is fuzzy understanding that is important. 

The diagrams are imperfect representation of shared understanding.

You want to have good shared understanding. That is what matters.

Another defn: design decisions that must be set early.

RJ: They are decisions that you wish you could get right early.

In reality, you don't have the information. You learn it while you work on it. 
- 
Better: Decisions that are hard to change. 

Programming language is a decision hard to change. But it isn't a top level component.

Two things:

- shared understanding
- hard to change

-> the important stuff whatever that is

Why is architecture important?

"We need to put less effort on quality so we can build more features for our next release"

Software architecture is important for moral reasons. 

This is a battle between craftmanship and economics. Economics always wins.

You have to formulate in terms of economics. 

Quality in sw means a lot of different things.

- pleasant user interface
- few defects
- good modular design (not visible)

External quality: visible to user

Architecture is internal quality.

Its benefits come in long term.

Design Stamina Hypothesis

Bad architecture: adding new features become harder and harder

Goo: I can accelerate

Notes in: Vivaldi Memex. 

@mine: re Spec: Haskell'in avantajı denilen compile time'da type checking aslında yeterli değil. Çünkü type'lar yeterince detaylı bir şekilde kontrat doğrulaması yapmıyor. Bunu yapabilmek için, meta-programlama kabiliyeti maksimum olan bir dil kullanmak daha doğru. Zaten istediğin yüklemleri kolayca tanımlayabiiyorsan, bunu dilin sentaksına eklemenin bir anlamı yok.
