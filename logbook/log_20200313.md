## Article: Definitions: IFR CFR

http://theconversation.com/how-big-will-the-coronavirus-epidemic-be-an-epidemiologist-updates-his-concerns-133133

IFR: The infection fatality rate (IFR) gives the probability of dying for an infected person

CFR: probability of dying for an infected person who is sick enough to report to a hospital or clinic

> CFR is larger than IFR, because individuals who report to hospitals are typically more severely ill

## Article: SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus case fatality ratio

> at the beginning of January, the CFR was much higher in Wuhan than in other areas of China. This skewed CFR is due to lack of hospital care for the many infected individuals. In areas of China other than Wuhan, patients with serious disease could obtain excellent hospital care

# Article: Estimating the infection and case fatality ratio for COVID-19 using age-adjusted data from the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship

> In real-time, estimates of the case fatality ratio (CFR) and infection fatality ratio (IFR) can be biased upwards by under-reporting of cases and downwards by failure to account for the delay from confirmation-to-death.

> During an outbreak, the so-called naive CFR (nCFR), i.e. the ratio of reported deaths date to reported cases to date, will underestimate the true CFR because the outcome (recovery or death) is not known for all cases [4]. We can therefore estimate the true denominator for the CFR (i.e. the number of cases with known outcomes) by accounting for the delay from confirmation-to-death [5]. 

nCFR: naive CFR

cCFR: corrected CFR

nCFR: not known for all cases (whether some patients will die)

## (394) Hydrophilic vs Hydrophobic | Substances | Cell Membranes - YouTube

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbaScpYu8Vs

Hydrophilic: dissolve in water

water is polar

ex: ionic compounds, polar molecules

Hydrophobic: do not dissolve in water

non-polar molecules 

ex: fat, oil

cell membrane: both hydrophilic and hydrophobic portions.

## Article: How does soap work?

https://www.worldofmolecules.com/3D/how-does-soap-work.html

> The cleansing action of soap is determined by its polar and non-polar structures in conjunction with an application of solubility principles. The long hydrocarbon chain is non-polar and hydrophobic (repelled by water). The "salt" end of the soap molecule is ionic and hydrophilic (water soluble)

> The soap will form micelles (see below) and trap the fats within the micelle. Since the micelle is soluble in water, it can easily be washed away

> They found that it remained virulent on surfaces for a lengthy period: from up to 24 hours on cardboard to up to two or three days on plastic and stainless steel. It also remained viable in aerosols—attached to particles that stay aloft in the air—for up to three hours

		Havada yaşıyor olması, hava yoluyla bulaşmanın (aerosol transmission) kanıtı değil.

		Hava yoluyla bulaştığını destekleyen araştırma: Osterhalm spread simply through breathing, even without coughing.

> Joseph Allen, He points out that methods of transmission should be thought of as a spectrum, and that the difference between droplets and aerosols isn’t so stark
