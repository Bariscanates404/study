## Article: A Surprisingly Common Mistake Involving Wildcards & The Find Command

https://blog.robertelder.org/find-command-wildcard-globbing/

Check `~/projects/study/logbook/ex/log_20200209/ex01/main.c`

``` bash
gcc main.c
``` 

``` bash
./a.out *.py
``` 

``` bash
touch foo.py
./a.out *.py
  ##> argc=2
  ##> Arg 0 is: './a.out'
  ##> Arg 1 is: 'foo.py'
``` 

Shell first expands wildcard pattern. Then it passes these expanded names to the program. This is `globbing`

``` bash
man glob
``` 

Lesson: Always quote wildcard chars when used as options for a command:

``` bash
find . -name '*.jpg'
```
