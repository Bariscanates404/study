# Video: Organizing Functional Code for Parallel Execution; or, foldl and foldr Considered Slightly Harmful

![Parallel Computation Tree](/Users/mertnuhoglu/gdrive/keynote_resimler/screencapture/20200429102122.png)

Summations and list constructors and loops are alike:

- Generate a collection
- body computes a function of each item
- combine the results
- in other words: generate-and-reduce

## New Mindset for Multicores:

DO loops are so 1950s.

Linear linked lists too

Java iterators are so last millenium.

They are all sequential

Arrays are suspect. You can't make big arrays. Ultimately, it's all trees.

Accumulators are BAD for palallelism. `first, SUM = 0`

`foldl` and `foldr`, though functional, are fundamentally accumulative.

## Parallel Future

- top-down view

Don't split a problem into "the first" and "the rest"
Split a problem into roughly equal pieces.

Recursively solve subproblems

Combine subsolutions.

- buttom-up view

don't create a null solution, then successively update it.

Instead, map inputs independently to singleton solutions

Then merge the subsolutions treewise.
