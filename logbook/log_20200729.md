Where to keep the state?

- store (as in redux)

Then we have new architecture layer:

		Frontend: UI (dynamic) -> View Logic -> The Store 
		Backend: REST API -> Business Logic -> ORM
		[Frontend] HTTP calls (ajax) -> [Backend]
		[Backend] JSON -> [Frontend]

Some data comes from user: clicks, form inputs

Some data comes from the server.

When we use the store to keep the data from the store, then this is local cache.

Then we need to keep local cache with server data in sync.

Then we have a new data binding problem: 

Binding between: state in local cache and state in server

How to implement this data binding?

opt01: REST API

They don't fit our needs.

My UI needs this: 

```clojure
user
	first_name
	friends
		first_name
		first_name
```

Problem: over-fetching and under-fetching.

REST API doesn't fit our needs. We do round trips where we get useless data. The problem is: tight coupling.

How do they do in back end? They query.

Why don't we do the same thing?

This is GraphQL and Falcor and OmNext.

New architecture:

		Frontend: UI (dynamic) -> View Logic -> The Store 
		Backend: Single Endpoint API -> Business Logic -> ORM
		[Frontend] Query -> [Backend]
		[Backend] JSON -> [Frontend]

Now, we solved over-fetching and under-fetching.

But, frontend cache problem still exists. How can we cache the data in frontend?

That is where Falcor client and Relay come into play.

Falcor client interacts with Falcor server.

It is similar to React. It introduced abstraction layer between developer and DOM. Don't worry about DOM. Give me the state. I will produce the DOM.

Falcor client works the same way. Don't worry about network. Just ask me the data. I will provide you the data.

They manage

- data caching
- request optimization

You just specify what data you need.

New architecture:

		Frontend: UI (dynamic) -> View Logic -> The Store -> OGM (Relay/Falcor)
		Backend: Single Endpoint API -> Business Logic 
		[Frontend] Query -> [Backend]
		[Backend] JSON -> [Frontend]

OGM: object graph mapping

We treat back end as persistence layer.

We know there is some latency. But we don't bother around.

Data binding comes down to observation pattern. 

		[Component] maps -> The DOM
		[Component] observes -> App State

All frameworks implement this in different ways:

- events
- dirty checking
- virtual DOM
- streams

Data-binding should be embedded into the language.
