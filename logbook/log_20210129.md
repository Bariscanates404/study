I setup Conjure and deoplete plugins as described in [Conjuring Clojure in Vim](https://blog.djy.io/conjuring-clojure-in-vim/). I can connect to an nREPL or prepl server and do evaluations inside Vim. 

But I cannot see the help docs inside floating window as shown in the blog post. Is there something else I need to do in order to enable them?
