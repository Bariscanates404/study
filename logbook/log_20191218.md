> Instead of trying to anticipate low-probability, high-impact events, we should reduce our vulnerability to them. Risk management, we believe, should be about lessening the impact of what we don’t understand—not a futile attempt to develop sophisticated techniques and stories that perpetuate our illusions of being able to understand and predict the social and economic environment

6 mistakes:

1. We think we can manage risk by predicting extreme events.
This is the worst error we make, for a couple of reasons. 

It’s more effective to focus on the consequences—that is, to evaluate the possible impact of extreme events

2. We are convinced that studying the past will help us manage risk.

Black Swan events don’t have precedents

today’s world doesn’t resemble the past; both interdependencies and nonlinearities have increased

There are two kinds, with socioeconomic randomness being less structured and tractable than the randomness you encounter in statistics textbooks and casinos. It causes winner-take-all effects that have severe consequences. Less than 0.25% of all the companies listed in the world represent around half the market capitalization, less than 0.2% of books account for approximately half their sales, less than 0.1% of drugs generate a little more than half the pharmaceutical industry’s sales—and less than 0.1% of risky events will cause at least half your losses.

3. We don’t listen to advice about what we shouldn’t do.
Recommendations of the “don’t” kind are usually more robust than “dos.” For instance, telling someone not to smoke outweighs any other health-related advice you can provide

Psychologists distinguish between acts of commission and those of omission. Although their impact is the same in economic terms—a dollar not lost is a dollar earned—risk managers don’t treat them equally. They place a greater emphasis on earning profits than they do on avoiding losses. However, a company can be successful by preventing losses while its rivals go bust—and it can then take market share from them. In chess, grand masters focus on avoiding errors; rookies try to win. Similarly, risk managers don’t like not to invest and thereby conserve value

Positive advice is the province of the charlatan. The business sections in bookstores are full of success stories; there are far fewer tomes about failure

4. We assume that risk can be measured by standard deviation.
Standard deviation—used extensively in finance as a measure of investment risk—shouldn’t be used in risk management.

Risk managers should avoid using methods and measures connected to standard deviation, such as regression models, R-squares, and betas.

In experiments we conducted in 2007, we gave a group of quants information about the average absolute movement of a stock (the mean absolute deviation), and they promptly confused it with the standard deviation when asked to perform some computations. When experts are confused, it’s unlikely that other people will get it right

5. We don’t appreciate that what’s mathematically equivalent isn’t psychologically so.

6. We are taught that efficiency and maximizing shareholder value don’t tolerate redundancy.

In companies, redundancy consists of apparent inefficiency: idle capacities, unused parts, and money that isn’t put to work. The opposite is leverage, which we are taught is good. It isn’t; debt makes companies—and the economic system—fragile. If you are highly leveraged, you could go under if your company misses a sales forecast, interest rates change, or other risks crop up

What will happen if the price of wine collapses? In the 1800s many cultures in Arizona and New Mexico vanished because they depended on a few crops that couldn’t survive changes in the environment.

One of the myths about capitalism is that it is about incentives. It is also about disincentives. No one should have a piece of the upside without a share of the downside

That’s why many CEOs become rich while shareholders stay poor. Society and shareholders should have the legal power to get back the bonuses of those who fail us.

Moreover, we shouldn’t offer bonuses to those who manage risky establishments such as nuclear plants and banks. The chances are that they will cut corners in order to maximize profits. Society gives its greatest risk-management task to the military, but soldiers don’t get bonuses

Remember that the biggest risk lies within us: We overestimate our abilities and underestimate what can go wrong. The ancients considered hubris the greatest defect, and the gods punished it mercilessly
