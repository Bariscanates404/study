[Fulcro Developer's Guide](http://book.fulcrologic.com/)

### We Love React

Immutable friendly

React Native

### Om Principles

Typical ui work: too many flushing

History: jump in time. Easy to rollbock.

### Issues

Function closures at odds with reach component.

Cursors: too leaky an abstraction

Not pluggable enough

### Missing Pieces

Seamless sync

- How to get initial data
- How to get changes?

### Describe the problem

Generic problem for all remote client software

### Enumerate solutions

One idea is not enough.

### What is the actual problem?

Web browser: 

HTML was not built for generic UI. It was for linking documents.

### REST

A solution for remote data communication

Which is a terrible idea. The client never needs one resource. 

Bandwidth sucks. People put more and more resources into one endpoint.

### Demand Driven

Alternative to REST.

### Composition

A common property that must be maintined. 

Any solution must allow composable demands. Every demand should fit into a composable function.

### Interpretation

They don't hardcode what the demand means. 

Why is this important?

In UI. You ask: Where is my data? Is it remote or local?

UI shouldn't need to get involved with this problem. 

### First Solution: Relay/GraphQL

Relay exposes GraphQL syntax to clients.

Idea: Components annotated with composable query fragments.

Remote sync

### Second Solution: JSONGraph/Falcor

Netflix had a REST based system formerly.

After switching, they dropped 90% of their networking code.

JSONGraph: data oriented api to describe demand

Falcor: routing component

It takes json data structure client wants. Falcor routes it to microservices and returns exact shape that client wants.

### Third Solution: Datomic Pull Syntax

Get exactly what you need declaratively

It is recursive `select-keys`

GraphQL: string based syntax

Datomic: simple data

Ex:

``` bash
[:person/first-name
 :person/address]
``` 

address is an entity. It gets all the attributes.

``` bash
[:person/first-name
 {:person/address [:address/zip-code]}]
``` 

It is recursive. It is composable fragments.

### Synthesis

``` bash
(defui ContactList)
``` 

It takes no argument. You can never close over.


``` bash
	static om/Iquery
``` 

It is static method. You don't need to instantiate anything.

``` bash
	(query [this]
	  '[{:app/contacts ?contact}])
``` 

It is pull syntax. Declarative.

`?contact` somebody knows what contact is.

``` bash
  (params [this]
	  {:contact (om/get-query Contact)})
``` 

We will bind that to some other component. We will render a contact. Tell us what you need.

``` bash
  Object
	(render [this]
	  (let [{:keys [:app/contacts]} (om/props this)
		  (dom/div nil
			  (dom/h3 nil "Contacts")
				(apply dom/ul nil
				  (map #(dom/li nil (contact %)) contacts)))]))
``` 

`render` it just creates a normal js class

### Om Next

Gie each component a Datomic Pull Syntax fragment (relay)

Cursors disappear

Supply an optional server side router (like Falcor). Server side component.

### No cursors

Their goal was dependency tracking

Queries tell you dependencies

### Other changes

- custom data stores possible
- datomic superpowers: 
  - entity <-> ui component

### Demo

![get-query](/Users/mertnuhoglu/gdrive/keynote_resimler/screencapture/20200411163850.png)

I get the data of a ui component. I don't need to instantiate the ui component for this. It is a static method.
 
![fetch remote data of the ui component](/Users/mertnuhoglu/gdrive/keynote_resimler/screencapture/20200411163956.png)

Fetching the remote data at the endpoint of the ui component.

![changing ui query](/Users/mertnuhoglu/gdrive/keynote_resimler/screencapture/20200411164428.png)

![after](/Users/mertnuhoglu/gdrive/keynote_resimler/screencapture/20200411164526.png)

Changing the query will change ui data request and ui rendering.

### Todos

- Query updating
- Ring/pedestal datomic middleware
 
### Plan

- CLJS is bigger than Web
- React -> babel -> commonjs -> google closure
- CLJS-in-CLJS: get rid of jvm dependency.
	- Electron apps
	- node.js 
	- ios apps
	- online tutorials, demos

## Video: Why Build Solutions with Fulcro - Tom Toor

### React

- UI is a function:

``` bash
view = f(props)
``` 

Problem: props is a large tree

### HoC, Reagent

Higher order components

Splitting our UI into multiple states and multiple functions

``` bash
view1 = f1(props1)
view2 = f2(props2)
view3 = f3(props3)
``` 

That leads to new problems:

Complexity and state explosion.

And states are usually overlapping -> Duplicated state data

![duplicate data](/Users/mertnuhoglu/gdrive/keynote_resimler/screencapture/20200411192944.png)

### Example: Data Pools

![duplicate account information](/Users/mertnuhoglu/gdrive/keynote_resimler/screencapture/20200411193102.png)

`:account/name` information overlaps

### Reframe, Redux

Centralized data into one place: single atom, global object

- But still the data is denormalized. 
- It suffers same problems like data pools

- Event-based schemes to evolve state and side-effect

- Loop: events, effects, map state to props, render props to view

Dominos is reframe

- Result: 

State is more unified

Client side operations are more structured

- Problem:

They left out the rest of the stack

### Full-Stack Operation is Poorly Defined

- Difficulties unifying network interactions

- Graphs of side-effects that are difficult to reason about

- Accidental data duplication

- No defined structure for server interactions

- How ui-centric data will co-exist with full-stack data

### Event-centric systems

Another issue

Event-based chains of logic are hard to follow

- Delete item -> local ui change -> server request -> response -> event ...
- Full stack post processing logic is a bit disconnected event handling code

Reducing coupling: this is good

When consumer is written before the producer. They don't know each other. Like a library.

But we are building an application.

Remedy: state-machine

### Event-based Scalability Problems

Another problem with event systems: lots of implicit coupling

A loads some. B depends on A having loaded data. So it is impilcit coupling.

Network interactions lack coordination.

### Reality: It is not all front-end

We are remote from the real database

We are in a distributed system

Denial that we are in a distributed system won't make the problem go away

### Om Next and Fulcro

Ideas:

- ui component co-located identity/query

Putting identity with the queries

- Auto normalization of client database

- Reified mutations

Fulcro:

### We were missing a real database

Frontend clients don't apply database solutions.

Databases figured out how to avoid denormalized pools of data.

Clients should follow that.

### How much database?

In client, people store data in adhoc way.

We are used to it.

Imagine on server: we don't need database. But that is what we do in the client.

We need normalized data store and a query engine.

Key sequential queue updates.

### Data Normalization

![data normalization](/Users/mertnuhoglu/gdrive/keynote_resimler/screencapture/20200411200608.png)

How do we normalize the data tree we get from the server?

![ui and data tree](/Users/mertnuhoglu/gdrive/keynote_resimler/screencapture/20200412090412.png)

Our ui components have explicit data requirements. We will use it to normalize data.

We colocate identity and query information on the ui components. 

![colocated identity and query](/Users/mertnuhoglu/gdrive/keynote_resimler/screencapture/20200412090607.png)

Identity and query information is used for normalization.

App state is client database.

### Automatic Normalization

![tree response](/Users/mertnuhoglu/gdrive/keynote_resimler/screencapture/20200412090756.png)

![automatic normalization](/Users/mertnuhoglu/gdrive/keynote_resimler/screencapture/20200412090815.png)

Server can respond with duplicate data. Fulcro normalizes it automatically.

### Query Engine

Now, we put the data into our client database. Now we need to put it into our ui components using query engine.

How much query engine?

It needs to be very fast. 8 ms in order to keep 60 fps. We don't need datalog or sql. 

Simple joins and props is required. 

### Fulcro's Client Queries

EQL: query language

Pathom: graphql alternative

### Pathom

Runs on client too. 

Any server-side database

### Client Mutatitions

How will we update client and server db?

In distributed systems, we want ACID. But we can't because backend is arbitrary.

Reified groupings: it contains intent. You implement them.

### Reified Mutations

Fulcro doesn't use events, it uses reified mutations.

``` bash
`(delete-item {:item/id})`
``` 

They are lists but look like function invocations.

They can be grouped into transactions:

``` bash
`[(f) (g) (h)]`` 
``` 

To perform: use `transact`

``` bash
(let [handler #(transact! this `[(delete-item {:item/id ~id})])]
	(div {:onClick handler} "Delete"))
``` 

They are defined in `defmutation` macros:

``` bash
(defmutation delete-item
	"Removes the item ..."
	[{:keys [item/id]}]
	(action [{:keys [state]}]
		(swap! state dissoc :item/id id)))
``` 

Since they are symbols, they have definitions.

state: client database

To perform full stack mutate, use `remote`

``` bash
(defmutation delete-item
	"Removes the item ..."
	[{:keys [item/id]}]
	(action [{:keys [state]}]
		(swap! state dissoc :item/id id)))
	(remote [_] :http-api)
``` 

On success, on failure error handlers:

``` bash
(defmutation delete-item
	"Removes the item ..."
	[{:keys [item/id]}]
	(action [{:keys [state]}]
		(swap! state dissoc :item/id id)))
	(remote [_] :http-api)
	(ok-action [_] (log/info "success"))
	(error-action [_] (log/error "error"))
``` 

On the server, we define mutation with the same name:

``` bash
(defmutation delete-item
	[{:keys [item/id]}]
	(action [{:keys [conn]}]
		@(d/transact conn [[:db.fn/retractEntity id]])))
``` 

Fulcro will take care of communication.

If the server is expected to return something:

``` bash
(defsc Session,,,)

(defmutation login!
	[{:keys [username password]}]
	(remote [env] (returning env Session)))
``` 

The client specifies what it expects. Fulcro will take that response, normalizes it, and puts it into client database.

### Fulcro lifecycle

``` bash
state* = f(state)  # (mutation/load)
props = QueryEngine(ui-components, state*)   # (query)
view = ui(props)   # (React)
``` 

This fixes:

- Data pooling problem
- Decouples ui from behavior
- Caching store

### State Machines

Declared as maps. 

### Scalable Development

IDE navigation for everything

Data model: 

- Where is the data? 
  - Always in the client database
	- One level deep, keyed by identity
	- Identity is kept in the ui component
- Updating denormalized trees
- Rollbacks

### Fulcro Inspect

Viewing client database

Element explorer in the ui: query, props

Network: performance bottlenecks

Query builder

### Business challenges

The model is different.

### RAD

Generates CRUD, reports, authentication

## Video: Fulcro RAD – Preview

Goals:

- Minimal boilerplate
- Easily escape to custom code

Library features:

- Open model: Everything will be a map. Keys will be namespaced. 
- Declarative data model
  - Migrations of schemas is tough
	- Demand driven server APIs
	- Declarative permissions model
- Authentication
- Forms
	- CRUD stuff
	- Validation, rendering, permissions, etc.
	- Extensible
	- Graph-based forms: nested forms
	- Generate UI with ability to override
- Reports
	- Input parameters

### Datomic

Even fp programmers were doing update in place. 

What if we get rid of update-in-place?

Purely functional data structures. Let's do it on disk.

Suddenly a lot of wrong things very easy:

- Auditing
- Queries over time

### Why fixed ideas are problematic in tech industry

C.P.Snow: Two cultures and the scientific revolution

Art and science. Two different cultures. 

Science: looking for objective truth.

Art: subjective truth

In art: most of your work is not so good. 

Alan Kay: A change in perspective is worth 80 IQ points.

> Humans are wired in a certain way. We get our ideas by social validation. We don't think about it.

G.Polya: How To Solve It

We don't know how to find problems. We can't see them in front of our eyes because of fixed ideas.

Now, redux is defacto standard. It is like a central database, single atom store.
