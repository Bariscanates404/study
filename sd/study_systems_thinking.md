# Article: From service design to systems change | by Adam Groves | Medium

![Systems Leverage Map - 90% percent of current effort](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vRKbh5bUKoHdrqxxfmC9aWGWJ2hPM_Cz5rxelIiZObR__havvzH9RQZrbtvRasz5YX8TDS-ThJvy20Q/pub?w=1613&h=1079)

We respond to what has happened after the fact.

Ex: A social service to support young people

option 01: More support workers

option 02: Root cause improvements

4 Groups for Leverage Points:

- Changing the ‘paradigm’
The values, goals and mindsets of actors who are shaping the direction of a system.

(e.g. changing a group’s goal, changing big and unstated assumptions).

- Changing the system ‘design’ 
The structure of information flows and rules, and the power to evolve and adapt.

(e.g. modifying lines of accountability, introducing new feedbacks, ensuring cultural diversity, allowing for multiple approaches).

- Dampening/Amplifying ‘feedbacks’ 
The interactions between elements in the system.

(e.g. reducing the drivers of ‘spiraling problems’, quickening course correction, making incentive schemes more effective, increasing transparency). 

- Increasing/Decreasing ‘parameters’
The basic numbers and ‘parameters’ of the system.

(e.g. changing spending, making staff changes, increasing incentives, increasing resource capacity relative to potential demand, setting standards). 

Mappings between 4 Groups and 12 Leverage Points:

1. Parameters:

- 12 Parameters
- 11 Size of buffers
- 10 Structure of material stocks and flows

2. Feedbacks:

- 9 Length of delays
- 8 Strength of negative feedback loops
- 7 Gain around positive feedback loops

3. Design:

- 6 Structure of information flows
- 5 Rules of the system (incentives, constraints)
- 4 Power to change or self-organize system structure

4. Intent:

- 3 Goals of the system
- 2 Mindset out of which the system arises
- 1 Power to transcend paradigms
