I wanted to automate the process from data modelling to testing it with sample data in actual database.

To describe the data models, I use a very simple domain specific language (DSL) called as `yuml`. `yuml` is developed and used by some UML tool called [yuml.me](http://yuml.me "yuml.me").

Starting from `yuml` the flow of information is as follows:

    | yuml -> uml | yuml_to_uml.sh |
    | yuml -> rdb | yuml_to_rdb.R  |
    | rdb -> ddl  | rdb_to_ddl.R   |
    | ddl -> data | ddl_to_data.sh |
    | rdb -> data | rdb_to_data.R  |

`rdb` is short for "requirements database". The name is actually a little misleading. Maybe, I should call it as "structural meta database". `rdb` files are some tsv/excel files that store meta data about the final product. I prefer to use `excel` instead of `tsv/csv` because it is easier to edit and view manually.

## yuml -> uml 

First step is converting `yuml` text to `uml` graphs. This is actually not required for data generation. But it is very easy to do and helps me visualize and understand the data model better.
