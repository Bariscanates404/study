I like UML diagrams but I don't like UML diagram editors because using them increases my work load. I don't want to maintain one more thing while developing software. 

`yuml` allows me to generate UML diagrams from text. I start data modelling in `yuml` text files. From these text files, I generate automatically a few useful documents such as:

1. UML diagrams
2. DDL (data definition language) statements for database 
3. RDB (requirements database) data

[RDB](/what_is_rdb/) is an abbreviation that I use for requirements database. I try to store all software specifications as structured data in a relational database format.

The notation used in yuml files is defined in `yuml.me` website. It is a way to describe UML diagrams using text.

`^-` symbol denotes a super-subtype relationship. 

`-` symbol denotes an association relationship. 

`=` symbol denotes double associations.

Refer to the following web page to learn the notation: http://yuml.me/diagram/scruffy/class/samples

yuml.me is a free web site that generates UML diagrams from yuml formatted text. There is an unofficial command line client for yuml web app: https://github.com/wandernauta/yuml

I use that command line client to generate UML diagrams automatically. Currently, the source code for my code is here: https://github.com/mertnuhoglu/yuml_to_rdb_schema/tree/master/inst/bash/main_yuml_to_uml.sh

I will move this script to its own github repo. Currently, it is inside a related R package called `yumltordbschema`.

By convention, I put all yuml formatted data models into files whose name start with `data_model` or `datamodel`. `main_yuml_to_uml.sh` script searches all those files, does some text cleaning and calls the actual `yuml` command line tool. 

For example, I described data models of two subsystems called "order" and "enum". I wrote their yuml code inside two files: `datamodel_order01.md` and `datamodel_enum01.md`

``` {bash}
cat data/datamodel_enum01.md
``` 

``` {bash}
cat data/datamodel_order01.md
``` 

To generate UML diagrams run the script:

``` {bash}
sh /Users/mertnuhoglu/projects/yumltordbschema/inst/bash/main_yuml_to_uml.sh data/
``` 

The script produces UML diagrams under `img/` directory:

``` {bash}
ls data/img
``` 

These are the generated UML diagrams:
